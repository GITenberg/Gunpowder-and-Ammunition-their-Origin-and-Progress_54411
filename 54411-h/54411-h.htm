<h4>I</h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Much</span> discussion has been caused in the past by the
vagueness of the word <em>gunpowder</em>. The following
are the meanings which this and a few other words
bear in these pages:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2"><em>Explosion.</em>&mdash;The sudden and violent generation,
with a loud noise and in a time inappreciable
by the unaided senses, of a very great volume
of gas, by the combustion of a body occupying
a comparatively very small volume.</p>

<p class="indent2"><em>Progressive Combustion.</em>&mdash;Combustion which
takes place in a time appreciable by the unaided
senses, such as that of rocket composition
or a bit of paper.</p>

<p class="indent2"><em>Gunpowder.</em>&mdash;A mixture of saltpetre, charcoal,
and sulphur, which explodes. The signs of
its explosion are a bright flash, a loud noise,
and a large volume of smoke.</p>

<p class="indent2"><em>Incendiary</em> (for “incendiary composition”).&mdash;A
substance or mixture which burns progressively,
although fiercely, and is hard to put out.</p>

<p class="indent2"><em>Machine</em> always means an apparatus of the ballista
type.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>
<p class="indent2"><em>Cannon</em> includes bombards, mortars, guns, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="indent2"><em>Musket</em> includes all hand firearms charged with
gunpowder.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Of the many difficulties that beset the present
inquiry, two deserve special mention.</p>

<p>The first is the want of simple exactness in most
early writers when recording the facts from which
we have to draw our conclusions. At times their
descriptions are so meagre that it is difficult, if not
impossible, to decide whether certain projectiles
were incendiary or explosive. At other times they
abound in tropes and figures of speech which
amount to an unintentional <em>suggestio falsi</em>. “The
missiles spread themselves abroad like a cloud,” says
a Spanish Arab; “they roar like thunder; they
flame like a furnace; they reduce everything to
ashes.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> A projectile full of blazing Greek fire
appeared to Joinville to be of portentous bulk. It
flew through the midnight sky with thundering noise
like a fiery dragon, followed by a long trail of
flame; and it illumined the whole camp as with the
light of day.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Even to approach the truth, we must
prune such figures of rhetoric; and this is a dangerous
operation, for we may prune too much. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>only safeguard against these suggestive metaphors is
to keep steadily in view the distinctive peculiarities
of incendiary and explosive projectiles.</p>

<p>The incendiary shell was simply an envelope
intended to convey into the interior of a fort, ship,
&amp;c., a quantity of combustible matter, which burned
with such violence as to <em>set fire</em> to everything inflammable
that was near it. The primary object of
the explosive shell, on the other hand, was to <em>blow
up</em> whatever it fell upon. It might occasionally, by
the intense heat generated by the explosion,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> set fire
to its surroundings when inflammable; but this was
a mere incidental consequence of its action. Its
aim and end was to explode.</p>

<p>When a musket or cannon was fired there was
a bright flash, a loud, momentary report, and a large
volume of smoke.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> When an incendiary missile was
discharged from a machine there was no flash, but
little smoke, and the only sounds were the whizzing
and sputtering of the burning mixture and the
creaking and groaning of bolts, spars, ropes, &amp;c.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“With grisly soune out goth the greté gonne.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>An explosive missile made its way through the
air with little noise<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and less light:<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> during its flight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
the blazing contents of the incendiary shell doubtless
gave out much light and made a considerable
noise, as described by many early writers. When
an explosive shell reached its object there was,
sooner or later (if it acted at all), an explosion,
occasionally followed by a conflagration: an incendiary
shell produced a conflagration only.</p>

<p>The second difficulty arises from the change of
meaning which many technical words have undergone
in the lapse of years.</p>

<p>The Arabic word <em>barúd</em> originally meant <em>hail</em>,
was afterwards applied to <em>saltpetre</em>, and finally came
to signify <em>gunpowder</em>. Our own word <em>powder</em>,
which at first meant a fine, floury dust (<em>pulvis</em>),
is often used in the present day to designate the
stringy nitrocelluloid, <em>cordite</em>&mdash;smokeless powder.
The Chinese word <em>yo</em> means <em>gunpowder</em> now,
although its first meaning was a <em>drug</em> or <em>plant</em>.
For centuries gunpowder was called <em>kraut</em> in
Germany, and to this day it is called <em>kruid</em> in
Holland. The Danish <em>krud</em> has not long become
obsolete.</p>

<p>The present Chinese word for <em>firearm</em>, <em>huo p’áu</em>,
originally meant a <em>machine</em> for throwing blazing
incendiary matter. The Arabic word <em>bundúq</em> at
first meant a <em>hazel-nut</em>, secondly a <em>clay-pellet</em> the
size of a hazel-nut, thirdly a <em>bullet</em>, and finally a
<em>firearm</em>.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> The Latin <em>nochus</em>, a <em>hazel-nut</em>, is used,
strange to say, to designate a <em>smoke-ball</em> by an old
German military writer, Konrad Kyeser, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
“Bellifortis” dates from 1405.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> The word was
also applied in Germany to bullets in general,
and more particularly to projectiles discharged by
machines.</p>

<p>The word <em>Artillery</em>, both in France and England,
originally meant <em>bows and arrows</em>. In his original
account of the battle of Cressy, Froissart calls the
apparatus and bolts of the Genoese crossbowmen <em>leur
artillerie</em>; while a few lines further on he speaks of the
<em>kanons</em> of the English.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Ascham, writing in 1571,
says: “Artillerie nowadays is taken for two things:
gunnes and bowes.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Selden reminds us that <em>gonne</em>,
our present <em>gun</em>, at first meant a <em>machine</em> of the ballista
type.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> It is used in this sense in “Kyng Alisaunder,”
3268, written <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1275-1300, and other metrical
romances. Like the Arabic <em>bundúq</em>, the word is occasionally
applied to the <em>projectile</em>, as in the “Avowing
of Arthur,” st. 65. It is used in the modern sense,
as <em>cannon</em>, in the “Vision of Piers the Plowman,”
Passus xxi, C text, 293, a poem begun in 1362
and finally revised by its author in 1390; and in
all three meanings by Chaucer, in poems written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>during the last quarter of the fourteenth century;&mdash;as
a machine in the “Romaunt of the Rose,” 4176,
as a projectile in the “Legende of Good Women,”
637, and as a cannon in the “Hous of Fame,”
533.</p>

<p>“When the thing is perceived, the idea conceived,”
says Professor Whitney, “(men) find in the
existing resources of speech the means of its expression&mdash;a
name which formerly belonged to something
else in some way akin to it; a combination of
words,” &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> For example, a word, W, which has
always been the name of a thing, M, is applied to
some new thing, N, which has been devised for the
same use as M and answers the purpose better.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
W thus represents both M and N for an indefinite
time,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> until M eventually drops into disuse and W
comes to mean N and N only. The confusion
necessarily arising from the equivocal meaning of
W during this indefinite period, is entirely due, of
course, to neglect of Horace’s advice to coin new
names for new things.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Had a new name been
given to N from the first, no difficulty could possibly
have ensued, and our way would have been straight
and clear. But as matters have fallen out, not only
have we to determine whether W means M or N,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
whenever it is used during the transition period,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
but we have to meet the arguments of those, never
far off, who insist that because W meant N <em>finally</em>,
it must have meant N at some bygone time when
history and probability alike show that it meant M
and M only. Examples, enough and to spare, of
such arguments will be met with shortly.</p>

<p>In consequence of the change of meaning which
many military words have suffered, no translation
of passages in foreign books containing ambiguous
words should be relied upon, if access to the originals,
or faithful copies of them, can be obtained. As an
example of the necessity for this precaution, let us
compare a few sentences relating to the siege of
Jerusalem, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 70, from the “Polychronicon” of
Higden (<i>d.</i> cir. 1363), Rolls Series, iv. 429 <i>ff.</i>, with
the translations of them by Trevisa, 1385, and by
the author of MS. Harl. No. 2261, of <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1432-50.</p>

<p class="center">A</p>

<p class="indent3">(1) Inde Vespasianus ictu arietis murum conturbat

<p class="indent3">(2) Thanne Vaspacianus destourbed the wal with
the stroke of an engyne (Trevisa).</p>

<p class="indent3">(3) Wherefore Vespasian troublede the walle soore

<p class="indent3">(3) Titus causede his gunners to schote at the

<p>No suspicion rests upon either of these translators;
yet, were the original lost, a covert allusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>to cannon might be discovered in Trevisa’s translation
of B and C, and the Harleian translation of
A, C, and D would be put forward as proof positive
of their use.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>The claims of the Greeks to the invention of
gunpowder are examined in Chap. III. Chap. IV.
is an inquiry into the nature and authorship of the
<cite>Liber Ignium</cite> of Marcus Græcus. The claims of
the Arabs, Hindus, Chinese, and English are considered
in Chaps. V.-VIII. In Part II. the progress
of Ammunition is very briefly traced from the introduction
of cannon to the introduction of breechloading
arms.</p>

<p>As the book is addressed to the officers of the
Army, who seldom have a library at command, the
authorities for the statements of important facts
are generally given at length. On all controversial
points, when a foreign authority is quoted the
original<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> is given as well as the translation. I have
endeavoured to acknowledge my obligation in all
cases where quotations have been borrowed from
others without verification.</p>

<p>The invention of gunpowder was impossible
until the properties of saltpetre had become known.
We proceed, therefore, in the following chapter to
determine the approximate date of the discovery of
this salt.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER II<br /><br />

<small><small>SALTPETRE</small></small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> attention of the ancients was naturally attracted
by the efflorescences which form on certain
stones, on walls, and in caves and cellars; and the
Hindus and nomad Arabs must have noticed the
deflagration of at least one of them when a fire was
lit on it. These efflorescences consist of various
salts,&mdash;sulphate and carbonate of soda, chloride of
sodium, saltpetre, &amp;c.&mdash;but they are so similar in
appearance and taste, the only two criteria known
in primitive times,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> that early observers succeeded
in discriminating only one of them, common salt,
from the rest. So close, in fact, is the resemblance
between potash and soda, that their radical difference
was only finally established by Du Hamel in 1736.
Common salt received a distinctive name in remote
times; all other salts were grouped together under
such vague generic names as <em>nitrum</em>, <em>natron</em>, <em>afro-nitron</em>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>No trace of saltpetre has hitherto been found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>anywhere before the thirteenth century. The Greek
alchemists of preceding centuries are silent. There
is no saltpetre in the earliest recipe we possess for
Greek fire, No. 26 of the <cite>Liber Ignium</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> ascribed to
one Marcus Græcus, either as given in the Paris
MSS. of 1300, or in the Munich MS. of 1438. It
is true that the phrase <em>sal coctus</em> in this recipe has
been translated by <em>saltpetre</em> in M. Hœfer’s untrustworthy
<cite>Histoire de la Chimie</cite>, but as MM. Reinaud
and Favé remark: “Rien n’autorise à traduire
ainsi; le sel ordinaire a été souvent employé dans
les artifices.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> There is no instance in Latin, I
believe, of saltpetre being designated otherwise than
by <em>sal petræ</em> (or <em>petrosus</em>), or by <em>nitrum</em>, singly or in
combination with some other word, as <em>spuma nitri</em>.
The substitution of <em>sal petræ</em> for <em>sal coctus</em>, in later
editions of the recipe, only shows that when the
valuable properties of saltpetre became known it
was employed instead of common salt. The very
fact of the change having been made by most of the
later alchemists, proves that to them <em>sal coctus</em> did
not mean <em>sal petræ</em>, but something else. If <em>sal
coctus</em> had meant <em>sal petræ</em>, what need was there for
the change? This change, however, was not universal.
In the version of recipe 26, given in the
<cite>Livre de Canonnerie et Artifice de Feu</cite>, published
in Paris in 1561, but written long before by a fire-worker
well acquainted with saltpetre, we find:
“prenez soufre vif, tarte, farcocoly (sarcocolla),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>peghel (pitch), sarcosti (sal coctum), &amp;c.”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> The
word <em>coquo</em> (to boil or evaporate) was necessarily
connected with the preparation of common salt by
evaporation,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and <em>coctus</em> would correctly distinguish
evaporated or artificial salt from natural or rock
salt. In his “Natural History,” xxxi. 39 (7), Pliny
tells us that salt is found round the edges of certain
lakes in Sicily which are partially dried up in
summer by the heat of the sun; while in Phrygia,
where much greater evaporation takes place (<cite>ubi
largius coquitur</cite>), a lake is dried up (and salt is
deposited) to its very middle. <em>Sal coctus</em> was salt
recovered from salt water by natural or artificial
heat, as distinguished from natural, or rock salt,
which was dug out of the ground.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The Arab alchemists before the thirteenth century
are as silent as the Greeks: nothing that can
be identified with saltpetre is to be found in their
voluminous works. The evidence of Geber, so often
cited to prove that saltpetre was known to the
Arabs in the ninth century, has been stripped of all
authority by M. Berthelot, who has satisfactorily
proved that there were two Gebers. The real Arab,
Jabir, says nothing of saltpetre, but he mentions a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>salve used by naphtha-throwers<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> as a safeguard
against burns. The other Geber, or pseudo-Jabir,
was acquainted with saltpetre, as well he might be;
for he was a western who lived some time about the
year 1300,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> and wrote a number of Latin works
falsely purporting to be translations from the Arabic
of the real Jabir. All doubt about the matter has
been removed by M. Berthelot’s publication of the
real Jabir’s Arabic writings.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> It has been also suspected
that the <em>sal Indicus</em> of the <em>Liber Sacerdotum,
cir.</em> tenth century,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> a salt again mentioned in the
<em>Liber Secretorum</em> of Bubacar, <i>cir.</i> 1000,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> means
saltpetre. Both these works are translations from
the Arabic or Persian,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and <em>sal Indicus</em> is the literal
translation of the Persian&mdash;نمك هندي (nimaki
Hindi) = نمك سياه (nimaki siyah) = salt of bitumen;
a substance of the same family as the “salt of
naphtha” also mentioned by Bubacar.</p>

<p>There is no word for saltpetre in classical San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>skrit,
<em>sauverchala</em> being a generic term for natural
salts, which corresponded to, and was as comprehensive
as the <em>nitrum</em>, <em>spuma nitri</em>, &amp;c., of the West.
“Recent Sanskrit formulæ for the preparation
of mineral acids containing nitre, mention this salt
under the name of <em>soraka</em>. This word, however,
is not met with in any Sanskrit dictionary, and is
evidently Sanskritised from the vernacular <em>sora</em>, a
term of foreign origin.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Both Professor H. H.
Wilson and Professor M. Williams, in their Sanskrit
dictionaries, “erroneously render <em>yavakshara</em>
as saltpetre, as also does Colebrooke in his ‘Amara-kosha.’”<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
The word means impure carbonate of
potash obtained by the incineration of barley straw.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>At length, however, notwithstanding coarse
scales and clumsy apparatus, the want of all means
of registering time and temperature, and the absence
of any general principle to guide them in their researches,
the alchemists succeeded in differentiating
certain natural salts from the rest, and among them
saltpetre. The Chinese were acquainted with it
about the middle of the thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Abd
Allah ibn al-Baythar, who died at Damascus in
1248, tells us that the <em>flower of the stone of Assos</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>was called <em>Chinese snow</em> by the Egyptian physicians
and <em>barūd</em> (<i>i.e.</i> saltpetre) by the (Arab) people of
the West.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Friar Bacon, whose <em>De Secretis</em> was
written before 1249, and Hassan er-Rammah who
wrote 1275-95, were thoroughly acquainted with the
salt. A grand chemical discovery had been made,
and saltpetre became known from China to Spain.</p>

<p>The Egyptians thought fit to call saltpetre
“Chinese snow,” but this does not justify the
conclusion that the discovery was made by the
Chinese. Consider our own phrases “Jerusalem”
artichoke, “Welsh” onion, and “Turkey” cock.
Jerusalem is a gardener’s corruption of <em>girasole</em>, the
Turkey came from America, and the home of the
Welsh onion is Siberia. The Persians called their
native alkaline salt <em>jamadi Chini</em>, and no one will
suggest that this substance came from China.</p>

<p>It is evident from the way in which it is mentioned
by the alchemists of the thirteenth century,
and from their primitive methods of refining it, that
saltpetre was then in its infancy. Roger Bacon
speaks of it as one would speak of a substance
recently discovered and still little known&mdash;“that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>salt which is called saltpetre” (<cite>illius salis qui sal
petræ vocatur</cite>).<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Marcus Græcus thought it necessary
to explain what the word means, in his 14th
recipe which probably belongs to the latter years
of the thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> The methods of refining
the salt given by Marcus and Hassan leave no
possible doubt that in their time it had but just
come into use. It is true that Bacon’s method was
much superior, if the solution of his steganogram
given in Chap. viii. be accepted. But it would
have been past all explanation had the method of
the greatest natural philosopher of the age been
found to be no better than that of an Arabic druggist
or a European fireworker.</p>

<p>As the matter is one of the greatest importance,

with that of Whitehorne, 1560. The Waltham

<p>A. <cite>Preparation of grough from natural saltpetre.</cite><a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>Natural saltpetre is dissolved in boiling water,
the insoluble impurities removed, and the solution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>evaporated by the sun or artificial heat. The solid
residue is grough saltpetre, and contains 1 to 10
per cent. of impurities, consisting of the chlorides
of potassium and sodium, sulphates of potash, soda,
and calcium, vegetable matter, sand, and moisture.</p>

<p class="center">B. <i>Boiling the solution of grough saltpetre.</i></p>

<p>The grough saltpetre is placed in an open
copper with a false bottom; water is added, and
heat applied until the mixture boils at 110° C.</p>

<p class="center">C. <i>Removal of the insoluble impurities.</i></p>

<p>The scum which rises to the surface during this
operation is removed by ladles; the sand and heavy
impurities fall upon the false bottom, which is removed
just before the mixture boils. The boiling is
continued until the scum ceases to rise.</p>

<p class="center">D. <i>Second boiling of the solution.</i></p>

<p>Cold water is added; the solution is boiled for
a few minutes, and then allowed to cool somewhat.</p>

<p class="center">E. <i>Filtration.</i></p>

<p>At 104.5° C. the mother liquid is transferred to
a tank with holes in its bottom, closed by filters.</p>

<p class="center">F. <i>Use of wood-ash, charcoal, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>If the impurities prevent the liquid from passing
freely through the filters, it is treated with glue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
wood-ash, or, better, with a little animal charcoal,
which seizes on the impurities and rises to the top
as scum.</p>

<p class="center">G. <i>Crystallisation.</i></p>

<p>The mother liquid filters into the crystallising
trough at 70.2° to 65.8° C.</p>

<p class="center">H. <i>Stirring the depositing solution.</i></p>

<p>The solution is kept in constant agitation by
poles whilst cooling, in order that it may deposit
in minute crystals, called <em>saltpetre flour</em>. Large
crystals contain more or less of the impure mother
liquid.</p>

<p class="center">I. <i>Washing and drying.</i></p>

<p>The agitation is discontinued at 25.8° C. and
the mother liquid drawn off. The flour is drained
on an inclined plane, transferred to a washing vat,
where it is washed three times with cold water, and
then finally dried.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Whitehorne</span>, 1560.</h4>

<p class="center">A. <i>Preparation of grough from natural saltpetre.</i></p>

<p>On the bottom of a vessel pierced with “three
or fower littell holes” is placed a linen cloth, “or
else the end of a broom, or some straw.” A layer
of nitrified earth, “a spanne thicknesse,” is laid on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
this, and on the earth “three fingers’ thicknesse” of
a mixture of “two parts of unslacked lime and three
of oke asshes, or other asshes.... And so, putting
one rewe” of saltpetre alternately with one of the
mixture, “you shall fill the tubbe ... within a
spanne of (its mouth), and the rest you will fill
with water.” The water, on percolating through
the mass, drips into a brass cauldron which, when
two-thirds full, is boiled “till it come to one-third
part or thereabouts. And after take it off and put
it to settell in a great vessell,” when it is to be
“clarified and from earthe and grosse matter diligentlie
purged.”</p>

<p class="center">B. <i>Boiling the solution of grough saltpetre.</i></p>

<p>The solution is then “taken and boyled of new.”</p>

<p class="center">F. <i>Use of wood-ash, animal charcoal, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>When the solution boils and throws up scum, it
is treated with a mixture of “3 parts of oke asshes
and 1 of lime, together with 4 lbs. of rock alum to
every 100 lbs. of the mother liquid.” “In a little
time you shall see it alaie, both clear and fair and of
an azure colour.”</p>

<p class="center">C. <i>Removal of insoluble impurities.</i></p>

<p>The heavy impurities, which sink to the bottom,
are got rid of by pouring the clarified mother liquid
into another vessel.</p>

it five potfulls” of the mixture. “In the same
quantity of water so prepared, put so much saltpeter
as it will dissolve.”</p>

deep.</p>

<p class="center">D´. <i>Third boiling of the solution.</i></p>

<p>The filtered liquid is boiled again “in order to
make the greater part of the water seeth away.... Make
it boil so much until you see it ready to
thicken, pouring in now and then a little of the
mixture” (F).</p>

<p class="center">G´. <i>Final crystallisation.</i></p>

<p>The mother liquid is then transferred to wooden

at the first setting.”</p>

<p>The simple and highly probable conclusion to
be drawn from the foregoing facts is, that saltpetre
was not discovered until the second quarter of the
thirteenth century; but this conclusion is not universally
accepted. It is said by some that although
saltpetre was unknown to the rest of the world until
then, it had been secretly used by the Greeks for
five hundred years. This theory will be examined
in the following chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br /><br />

<small><small>THE GREEKS</small></small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Homer</span> knew nothing apparently of incendiary compositions.
When the Trojans set fire to the Greek
ships, he certainly says that they burned with “unquenchable
flame” (ἀσβέστη φλόξ), <cite>Iliad</cite>, xvi. 123;
but this is a mere figure of speech, for presently
afterwards he tells us that Patroclus extinguished
the fire (κατὰ δ’ ἔσβεσεν αἰθόμενον πῦρ), 293.</p>

<p>The Assyrian bas-reliefs in the British Museum
prove that liquid fire was used in warfare in very
remote times. Whether the Greeks adopted its
use from the Orientals or originated it themselves,
there is little evidence to show; but traces of it are
found at an early date, for instance at the siege of
Syracuse,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> 413 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and the siege of Rhodes,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> 304 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
Vessels full of burning matter were thrown, at first
by hand, from walls and the tops of forts upon besiegers;
and when shell of suitable construction
had been devised, these missiles were discharged
from machines.</p>

<p>The earliest instance of the use of firearms by
the Greeks is found in Thucydides, ii. 75, where
it is stated that at the siege of Platæa, 429 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>Platæans found it necessary to protect a wooden
wall by skins and hides against the fire-arrows
(πυρφόροις ὀïστοῖς) of their Peloponnesian besiegers.
By the time of the Roman Empire, fire-arrows were
so well known as to be mentioned by the Latin
poets,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> and the historians speak of fire-lances which
were discharged from machines<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> (<cite>adactæ tormentis
ardentes hastæ</cite>). Vegetius, who lived in the fourth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, gives the composition of fire-arrows;<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
and Ammianus Marcellinus, who lived about the
same time, points out their defects. First, the fire-arrow
had to be discharged with a low velocity&mdash;<em>ictu
enim rapidiore extinguitur</em>; it was extinguished
by the cooling effect of the air when discharged
with the full force of the bow. Secondly, in addition
to its low velocity (and consequently limited
range) it was extinguished when covered with clay.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
However, the composition was easy to light and
hard to put out&mdash;even with clay or vinegar; its
viscosity enabled it to stick to the body it struck;
and, becoming more and more fluid from the heat
of combustion, it “spread like wild-fire.”</p>

<p>But the use of incendiaries was not confined to
grenades and arrows. At the siege of Platæa, just
referred to, the Spartans piled up faggots of brushwood
against the walls, and, after pouring a mixture
of sulphur and pitch on the heap, set fire to it in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>order to burn the town.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> They would have gained
their object but for a rainstorm which put out the
fire. We have here perhaps the earliest historical
account of the composition of an incendiary&mdash;429
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> At the siege of Delium, 424 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, a tree was
cut down and hollowed out, so as to form a tube,
and from one end of it, which was protected by a
covering of iron, was hung a cauldron containing a
burning mixture of charcoal, sulphur, and pitch.
Into this cauldron was introduced an iron bellows-pipe,
leading from the end of the tree from which
it hung. Having transported the machine close to
the wall of the town (the cauldron to the front), the
besiegers inserted the snout of a large bellows into
the other end of the hollowed tree, and blew them.
A great flame was thus produced; the wall, in which
there was much wood, was set on fire; the heat of
the fire and the vapour of the incendiary drove
the defenders from the walls, and the town fell.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
Its simplicity shows that the mixture belongs to the
infancy of incendiaries in Greece.</p>

<p>We meet with fire-ships as early as 413 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, when
the Syracusians employed one ineffectually against
the Athenian fleet;<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and a special incendiary for
naval use is recommended by Æneas, the tactician,
about 350 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> It consisted of sulphur, pitch, incense,
pine-wood, and tow. The mixture was stowed
in egg-shaped, wooden vessels, admirably adapted
for their purpose, which were thrown lighted upon
the enemy’s decks.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a><br /><br /></p>

<p>In such ways were incendiaries employed by the
Greeks for nearly eleven centuries after the siege of
Platæa. During this long period the composition
was of course improved, and the mixture of the
seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> burned more fiercely, and was
harder to put out than that of the fourth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>; but nevertheless the two mixtures were of the
same species. At length, in the decade 670-80, a
new species was devised. For the sake of clearness,
the old incendiary mixtures will henceforward be
called Greek fire; the new one “sea-fire.”</p>

<p>We are told by Theophanes in his “Chronography,”
written 811-815, that in the year 673 an
architect called Kallinikos<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> fled from Heliopolis
in Syria to the Romans (<i>i.e.</i> Constantinople), and
eventually compounded a “sea-fire” which enabled
them to burn large numbers of the Moslem vessels
engaged in the Seven Years’ War,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> 671-677. This
incendiary was again employed with success against
the Moslems during their second attack against
Constantinople, 717, and at the decisive naval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>victory over the Russians under Igor in 941. The
evidence of Theophanes about Kallinikos is corroborated
almost verbally by the Emperor Constantine
VII., Porphyrogenitus, in Chap. xlviii. of his
“Administration of the Empire”: “Be it known
that under the reign of Constantine Pogonatus (668-685)
one Kallinikos, who fled from Heliopolis to
the Romans, prepared a ‘wet-fire’ to be discharged
from siphons, by means of which the Romans burned
the fleet of the Saracens at Cyzicus and gained the
victory.”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> It is true that when writing to his son
(in Chap. xiii. of the same work) the Emperor
gives (or tells his son to give) a different version of
the invention of sea-fire: “If any persons venture
to inquire of you how this fire is prepared, withstand
them and dismiss them with some such answer as
this&mdash;that the secret was revealed by an angel to the
first Emperor Constantine” (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 323-337).<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> But
this passage only proves that the Emperor was
mendacious and his people superstitious. There
can be little doubt that this great invention was
made by a Greek for the Greeks in the decade 670-680;
but what was the nature of the mixture? All
we know for certain about it is that it was a State
secret, was intended for sea service, burned with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>much noise and vapour, and was projected from
siphons. In other words, the mixture fulfilled the
following conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Its composition could be kept secret.</p>

<p>(2) It had some close connection with the sea,
or water.</p>

<p>(3) It burned with much noise and smoke.</p>

<p>(4) It had some close connection with siphons,
or tubes.</p>

<p>The fact that the sea-fire was made a State secret
proves that it did not belong to the same family as
the Greek fire of Æneas and Vegetius which, in one
form or another, had been known all over the East
from time immemorial. It was a new mixture&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
either a mixture containing some substance not
hitherto known, or a mixture of known substances
not hitherto combined together for warlike purposes.
Many hold that an unknown substance was employed,
and, further, that it was no other than
saltpetre. We might, of course, fall back on the
conclusion established in Chap. ii., and reply
that saltpetre was not discovered until the thirteenth
century and could not have been used as
an ingredient of an incendiary in the seventh century.
But the conclusion drawn in Chap. ii. was
not a certain one: it was there characterised as
highly probable. Saltpetre might possibly have been
employed, and a belief which is shared in by some
good writers deserves respectful consideration. We
have, therefore, to investigate how far a saltpetre
mixture would satisfy the above four conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>There was absolutely nothing to attract public
attention in the purchase from time to time of common,
well-known substances, such as sulphur, quicklime,
naphtha, &amp;c. &amp;c., by the authorities of the
Arsenal; but the suspicions of the spies and traitors,
always to be found in Constantinople,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> would have
been instantly roused by the importation of any
new or rare substance such as saltpetre. And
whence could saltpetre have come? M. Berthelot
recognises the importance of this question, although
he cannot answer it: “Comment se procurait-on le
salpêtre?... Aucun renseignment n’est venu
nous l’apprendre. Ce point pourtant est capital.”<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
Saltpetre would naturally have been obtained from
the countries where it was most abundant and
cheapest&mdash;from the East; but the Greeks could not
have relied upon this source of supply, for whenever
political complications arose between the Emperor
and the Caliph&mdash;and they were interminable&mdash;the
ports of Egypt and Syria were closed against Greek
ships. However, saltpetre did not grow in the
streets of Constantinople: the natural salt (if used)
must have been collected <em>somewhere</em>, and sold to
Government by <em>someone</em>, and transported <em>somehow</em>
to the capital; and what despot could have tied the
tongues of collectors, merchants, sailors, and porters?
The mere facts that only one State trafficked in saltpetre,
that this State only bought it in time of war,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>and that this State alone employed sea-fire, would
have immediately betrayed the secret of its composition
to these men, and what was known to them
was known to the world. It is most improbable that
the use of saltpetre could have been concealed for one
year, much less the five hundred years during which
the secret of the sea-fire was successfully guarded.
I may be reminded of the Emperor Constantine
VII.’s statement (in Chap. xiii. of his “Administration,
&amp;c.”), that on one occasion a Roman general,
corrupted by a large bribe, did reveal the secret and
shortly afterwards, when entering a church, was
consumed by fire which fell from heaven upon him.
The story is obviously legendary. The venal general
is as unreal as the fire from heaven; he is merely
introduced to us as “an awful example,” and we
cannot endow him with reality by rejecting the fire.
The claim of the Marquess Carabbas to reality is not
established by denying the existence of Puss-in-Boots.
Had the secret been divulged the sea-fire
would have been used against the Greeks, and no
mixture that can be identified with it ever was.</p>

<p>A saltpetre mixture, then, would not, in all probability,
have fulfilled the first condition, nor would
it have fulfilled the second. There is no conceivable
connection between saltpetre and the sea, or water
in general. A saltpetre mixture (of suitable proportions)
would have proved a much better incendiary
than Greek fire, but it would have acted as
effectively from a fort as from a ship. Indeed, if we
consider the ill effect of the moist sea air on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
impure saltpetre of early times, we are justified in
saying that the action of such mixtures on land
would have been better, in general, than at sea.</p>

<p>A saltpetre mixture would have fulfilled the third
condition by burning with much noise and smoke,
which we may suppose to be the essential meaning
of the Emperor Leo’s phrase, “thunder and smoke.”<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>
We cannot reasonably attach greater significance to
one of the commonest of all metaphors, thunder,
which has been applied times unnumbered to the
human voice, to the bursting of a child’s cracker,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
and to the whirring of a dart. “Never burst such
peals from the thunder-cloud,” says Vergil, as were
produced by the javelin thrown by Æneas.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>As regards the fourth condition, the above statement
of the Emperor Constantine about sea-fire and
siphons<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> completely justifies us in concluding that
there was some necessary connection between the
two things. Now, there was no necessary connection
between saltpetre mixtures, even when explosive,
and siphons. Small quantities of such mixtures
could have been, and eventually were, thrown by
hand, in grenades, like Greek fire. Saltpetre mixtures,
therefore, would not have fulfilled the fourth
condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>The result of the foregoing inquiry is, that a
saltpetre mixture would have only fulfilled one, the
third, of the four conditions to which the sea-fire
was subject; and we have now to cast about for
some mixture of known substances, not hitherto
combined together for warlike purposes, which
would have fulfilled them all.</p>

<p>A clue to the composition of the Kallinikos
mixture may perhaps be found in its Greek name,
“sea-fire” or “wet-fire.” One substance had long
been known with whose combustion water was
closely connected&mdash;quicklime, and with its properties
Kallinikos, as an architect, must have been
perfectly familiar. Its temperature rises&mdash;to 150° C.
(302° F.) if the quantity be large&mdash;when sprinkled
with water, and it can consequently be employed to
ignite substances with low points of ignition. For
example, if a mixture of quicklime and naphtha be
thrown into water, the rapid rise in temperature of
the lime causes a sudden and strong development of
vapour from the naphtha, which on mixing with the
air becomes highly explosive. Such a mixture, it
is almost unnecessary to add, could not be handled
with safety <em>after</em> it has been wet. Plutarch was
aware of the explosive nature of naphtha vapour.
“Naphtha,” he says, “is like bitumen, and is so
easy to set on fire that, without touching it with
any flame, it will catch light from the rays which
are sent forth from a fire, burning the air which is
between both.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> Pliny speaks of the heat developed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>by quicklime when sprinkled with water. “It is
strange,” he says, “that what has already been burnt
should be ignited by water” (<em>mirum aliquid, postquam
arserit, accendi aquis</em>).<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> The same property is implicitly
referred to in the “Kestoi,” attributed to
Sextus Julius Africanus of Emaus, who lived under
Alexander Severus, 222-235. The military portions
of this work, however, must have been written long
afterwards, in the end of the sixth or the beginning
of the seventh century at the earliest; for Belisarius,
who was born in 505, is mentioned in the sixty-sixth
chapter.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> In the forty-fifth chapter there is a recipe
for a quicklime-asphalt composition, which is called
“automatic fire.” This mixture was used by jugglers
to exhibit “spontaneous combustion,” a little
water being secretly poured on a plate on which a
ball of the composition was placed.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> It contained
very little quicklime (παντελῶς ὀλίγον). Cameniata
tells us that at the storming of Salonika in 904 the
Moslems threw “pitch and torches and quicklime”
over the walls.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> By “quicklime” he probably meant
the earthenware hand grenades, filled with wet
quicklime, described by the Emperor Leo, who then
sat on the throne (886-911). “The vapour of the
quicklime,” he says, “when the pots are broken,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>stifles and chokes the enemy and distracts his
soldiers.”<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>The simplest and most probable explanation of
the nature of the sea-fire then is, that it was a
sulphur-quicklime-naphtha mixture of the same
family as those shown in the following Table.<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>

<p><br /><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;None of these mixtures professes to be the official Greek
sea-fire, the exact composition of which is unknown; but the “De
Mirabilibus” mixture is probably a close approximation to it. Although
called sea-fires here, they were not so called by their western
authors, who were ignorant of the use and even of the name of sea-fire.
The first four recipes are described as mixtures which will ignite
“when rain falls upon them.” Hartlieb alone foresaw that such mixtures
would ignite “if thrown upon water.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a mixture would have completely fulfilled
the four conditions already mentioned. First, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
secret of its composition was easy to keep, since it
lay in the choice and proportions of known ingredients;
not in the use of one special and unknown
substance (such as saltpetre), smuggled privily into
the Arsenal<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> with a mystery which was certain to
excite the curiosity of a people who “spent their
time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some
new thing.” Secondly, it was literally a “sea-fire” or
“wet-fire,”&mdash;a fire which was ignited by water and
which burned on its surface. Thirdly, its combustion
gave rise to a considerable volume of vapour and a
series of small explosions in the air. Fourthly, from
the mode of its combustion it was unsafe to handle
after ignition, and it was necessarily discharged from
siphons. This simple explanation of the sea-fire<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
sweeps away the insurmountable difficulties raised by
the saltpetre theory. We have no longer to believe in
the patriotic silence of Byzantine officials, workmen
and sailors, maintained for five hundred years; we
have no longer to admit reluctantly that saltpetre was
known in Greece, where it occurs in comparatively
scanty quantity, five hundred years before it was
known in the great natural storehouse of this salt,
Asia; we have no longer to suspect the whole body of
Greek writers on alchemy and pharmacy, from the
seventh to the thirteenth century, of having entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>into a vast conspiracy of silence to hide their knowledge
of saltpetre from the barbarians; we are no
longer left wondering whence the Greeks got their
saltpetre, and why they gave the name of “sea-fire”
to a mixture in no way connected with the sea; and
we are no longer perplexed by the fact that the
earliest recipes for Greek fire contain no saltpetre.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>It remains to inquire how the sea-fire was expelled
from the siphons.</p>

<p>There were two kinds of siphons, large siphons
and hand-siphons.</p>

<p>Of the hand-siphons there were several patterns.
Some seem to have been thrown by hand, like
squibs;<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> from others, mentioned by Cameniata, the
charge was projected by air<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>&mdash;presumably by a
bellows or some such contrivance; while in a third
kind, described by the Princess Anna, a pellet was
blown by the breath through a flame placed before
the front end of the tube.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> The two latter siphons
were of the same species, and as Anna’s was charged
with Greek fire<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> we may suppose Cameniata’s took
a similar charge.</p>

<p>The large sea-fire siphon was fixed in the bow of
the ship and served by the two foremost rowers, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>of whom laid the siphon and was called the siphonator,
while the other, we may suppose, loaded it.
The siphon was mounted on a swivel, as may be
gathered from the account given by the Princess
Anna of the naval battle fought near the island of
Rhodes in 1103 by the Greeks and the Pisans. The
latter were terrified, she says, by an apparatus which
directed on them fire of an extraordinary nature.
“Ordinary flame rises upwards, but this flame shot
downwards and sideways as well, at the will of the
gunner.”<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> Unless the siphon was mounted on a
swivel, the phrase which I have translated by “at
the will of the gunner” (ἐφ’ ἃ βούλεται ὁ πέμπων)
would be meaningless.</p>

<p>In his <cite>Recherche sur le Feu Grégeois</cite>, p. 23, M.
Chrétien-Lalanne maintains that the incendiary was
expelled from the siphon by means of a spring. This
theory is inadmissible, for helical springs are not
heard of until long after the time in question.
Further, the ancients possessed no means of condensing
air to the degree necessary for the projection
of a heavy body over even the short ranges of the
Dark Ages, and steam power had hardly been
recognised at all.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> Therefore, it has been urged,
the incendiary must have been expelled from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>siphon by means of an explosive saltpetre mixture,
this being the only way of effecting the object that
remained at the disposal of the ancients. As will be
seen presently, there remained a simple and efficacious
method, involving very little expense and no danger
whatever; a fact which in itself would be sufficient
to meet the above argument in favour of saltpetre,
even were it unsupported by the evidence already
brought forward in Chap. ii. to show that saltpetre
had not been yet discovered at the time in question,
and the evidence adduced in the present chapter
to prove that in fact it was not used. Further, the
supposition that an explosive was employed is
excluded by the construction of the siphon, which
was made of wood. Such is the only reasonable explanation
that can be given of the Emperor Leo’s
order that the siphons should be “cased with bronze.”<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
Had they been of metal, a casing of bronze would
have been a useless complication; but, being of wood,
an internal casing of metal was absolutely necessary
to protect them from the flame of the burning composition.
Only one round probably could have been
fired from a wooden tube by means of an explosive,
and that round in most cases would have been more
fatal to the siphon detachment than to the enemy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>
<p>Again, as the projectile was simply a lump of
oleaginous matter, it would have been blown by an
explosive cartridge into thousands of fragments, each
of them so small as to be worthless for incendiary
purposes; for the efficacy of an incendiary depends
to a great extent on its containing a large quantity
of matter.</p>

<p>Since the use of springs, compressed air, and
steam were impossible, and the use of an explosive
extremely improbable, it only remains to examine
the arguments for and against water as the motive
power.</p>

<p>The Emperor Leo VI. speaks of the “artificial
fire discharged by means of siphons;”<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> the Emperor
Constantine VII. speaks similarly of “the wet-fire
projected by means of siphons;”<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> and if we translate
<em>siphon</em> by <em>tube</em> both phrases are intelligible,
but neither gives any hint as to the means by which
the mixture was expelled from the tubes. But like
so many other military words, <em>siphon</em> has (at least)
two meanings, and signifies not only a tube, but a
<em>fire-engine</em>, or <em>water-engine</em>, or <em>squirt</em>. Heron of
Alexandria (<i>cir.</i> 130 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) begins his description
of a fire-engine with the words: “The <em>siphons</em> used
for the extinction of fire are made as follows.”<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
Pliny the Younger (<i>cir.</i> 100 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>), in a letter to the
Emperor Trajan about a fire which had taken place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>in the town of Nicomedia, observes that “there was
not a <em>sipho</em>, nor even a bucket, at hand to quench
it.”<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> Hesychius in his Greek Lexicon, about the
end of the fourth century, gives under σίφων: “an
apparatus for pumping water in conflagrations.”<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
If we translate <em>siphon</em> by <em>water-engine</em>, as we are
perfectly justified in doing, we find that the phrases
used by the two Emperors are not only intelligible,
but indicate both the mode of projection and the
mode of ignition of the sea-fire. The lump of
quicklime-naphtha-sulphur was projected, and at
the same time ignited, by applying the hose of a
water-engine to the breech of the tube, which thus
became an integral part of the apparatus to which
it gave its name.</p>

<p>Two obscure passages in Byzantine works, which
hitherto have never been satisfactorily explained,
are made clear by this interpretation. The first
occurs in the “Tactics” of Constantine VIII., where
he directs “‘flexible’ (apparatus) with (artificial)
fire, siphons, hand-siphons, and manjaniks” to be
employed, if they are at hand, against any tower
that may be advanced against the wall of a besieged
town.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> The “flexible” apparatus cannot refer to
the helical springs of a later age. Neither can it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>mean crossbows, for the Princess Anna, who wrote
a century after Constantine, expressly says: “The
crossbow (<em>tzangra</em>) is a foreign weapon (hitherto)
unknown in the Greek service.”<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> That it cannot
mean longbows is quite certain from the second of
the obscure passages in question, which occurs in
the “Alexiad”: “In the bow of each ship he
(the Admiral) put the heads of lions and other
land animals, made of brass and iron, gilt, so as
to be (quite) frightful to look at; and he arranged
that from their mouths, which were (wide) open,
should issue the fire to be delivered by the soldiers
by means of (or through) the ‘flexible’ apparatus.”<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
The enemy might have exclaimed with the Jewish
king: “They gaped upon me with their mouths,
as a ravening and as a roaring lion.” But whatever
the moral effect of these trumpery scarecrows&mdash;if
ever actually used&mdash;it is certain that archers with
longbows could not have shot fire-arrows through
them with any success; and the meaning of Emperor
and Princess remains hidden until we interpret
“flexible instrument” as the leathern hose of a
pump or water-engine, than which nothing can be
more flexible. The import of both passages then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>becomes perfectly plain. Such a mode of discharging
incendiaries is by no means unknown in later
military history. “Dans une expérience faite au
Havre, 1758, avec une pompe à huile de naphte,
dont le jet était enflammé par une mèche allumée,
on brûla même une chaloupe.”<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> At the siege of
Charleston, 1863, not only was solidified Greek fire
in tin tubes employed,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> but coal naphtha placed
in shells or pumped through hose.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> Finally, M. Berthelot
speaks of “les propositions faites, pendant
le siège de Paris (1870), pour repousser les ennemis
au moyen de pompes projetant des jets de pétrole
enflammé. Mais cet agent ... n’a été mis réellement
à l’épreuve que par la Commune, pour brûler
nos palais.”<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>When the Crusades began in 1097 Greeks
were thus in possession of two species of incendiaries:
the sea-fire which was distinctively and
exclusively Greek, and the old mixture of the
Æneas family which was known all over the East.
Yet it was to the latter that the name “Greek fire”
was given by the Crusaders, who, I believe, had
neither experience nor knowledge of the sea-fire.
The only passage I can recall among the old writers
in which the two fires are discriminated and correctly
named occurs in the metrical romance</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>“Richard Coer-de-Lion,” <i>temp.</i> Edward I. (1272-1307):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Kyng Richard, oute of hys galye,</div>
<div class="line">Caste wylde-fyr into the skye</div>
<div class="line">And fyr Gregeys into the see.</div>
<div class="line"><span class="gesperrt"><b>.....</b></span></div>
<div class="line">The see brent all off fyr Gregeys” (2627).<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Historically this passage is probably worthless;
but, whether deliberately or by accident, the poet
indicates the real distinction between the two fires.
It was the sea-fire, the true Greek fire, which was
thrown or fell into the sea; while the wild-fire, misnamed
“Greek fire” by the Crusaders, was flung
“into the sky” to descend on the heads of the
enemy. In the preceding pages I have adopted the
Crusaders’ nomenclature, because it is now too late
to rectify their blunder.</p>

<p>During the siege of Stirling Castle, 1304,
Edward I. “gave orders for the employment of
Greek fire, with which he had probably become
acquainted in the East.”<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> It was also made use of
by the Flemish engineer, Crab, who took an active
part in the defence of Berwick when besieged by
Edward II. in 1319:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>We again made use of Greek fire in the defence of
the Castle of Breteuil, and in the attack on the
Castle of Romorentin, in 1356;<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> but no record
remains of its composition or of the way in which
it was projected. It was no doubt similar to Whitehorne’s
wild-fire of 1560, given in Table II. As
late as 1571 Greek fire was poured down on the
heads of the Turks, in the primitive fashion, by the
Venetians in the defence of Famagusta.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>The phrase “Greek fire” never took root in
England, where “wild-fire” was early substituted
for it. Wild-fire is found in Robert of Gloucester’s
“Chronicle,”<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> of the same date as “Richard Coer-de-Lion.”
According to the <cite>Promptorium Parvulorum</cite>,
an English-Latin dictionary compiled in 1440 by
Galfridus, a Dominican of Lynn Episcopi in Norfolk,
the phrases “Greek fire” and “wild-fire” were then
synonymous; for he gives as the Latin equivalents
of the latter&mdash;“ignis Pelasgus, vel ignis pelagus, vel
ignis Græcus.” Among the ammunition supplied
to the troops sent to Scotland under Lord Lennox
in 1545, we find “xx tronckes charged with wylde
fyer.”<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> Whitehorne gives a plate of these tronckes
or trombes, which were hollow wooden cylinders,
“as bigge as a man’s thigh and the length of an
ell,” filled with the mixture given in Table II. for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>the sixteenth century. In Phillips’ English Dictionary,
1706, wild-fire is described as (1) “a sort of
fire invented by the Grecians about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.C.</span> 777,” and
(2) “gunpowder rolled up wet and set on fire.”
It is used in the latter sense in “Robinson Crusoe,”
published in 1719. Before an attack on the
Indians, the sailors “made some wild-fire ... by
wetting a little powder in the palms of their hands”
(Part ii. chap. 21). The word is only heard now in
the phrase “spreads like wildfire.”</p>

<p>But though its names have passed away, the
thing remains. Greek fire was used at the siege of
Charleston in 1863; in 1870 M. Berthelot watched its
effects when thrown into Paris by German guns; we
ourselves possess it to this day in our Carcass composition.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>
The sea-fire, on the other hand, was comparatively
short-lived, and I can find no certain evidence of
its employment after the year 1200. Its disappearance
is easily accounted for. From about the middle
of the eleventh century the Byzantines began to show
signs of an ever-increasing disinclination for war-service
either afloat or ashore,<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> a want of national
honour and military energy which Mr. Finlay
ascribes to “a general deficiency of common honesty
and personal courage;”<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> and this moral degeneracy
threw naval duties more and more into the hands
of the Venetians and other foreign mercenaries, to
whom the Government may have been unwilling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>to make known the secret of the sea-fire. This
state of things did not escape the notice of Benjamin
of Tudela, a Jewish traveller of the twelfth
century: “(Les Grecs) entretiennent des soldats à
gages de toutes les Nations qu’ils appellent Barbares,
pour faire la guerre au Roi des Peuples de
Togarma appellez Turcs. Car les Grecs eux-mêmes
n’ont ni cœur ni courage pour la guerre. Aussi
sont-ils reputez comme les femmes qui n’ont aucune
force pour combattre.”<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Matters came to a crisis
in 1200: in this year Michael Struphnos, the
admiral commanding, sold the naval stores at Constantinople
and appropriated the proceeds of the
sale.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> When, therefore, the pious warriors of the
Fourth Crusade turned their arms against their
fellow-Christians and beleaguered the city in April
1204, there was no sea-fire at hand for use against
their ships, and an attempt to burn them by means
of sixteen ordinary fire-ships was foiled by the
activity of the Venetian sailors.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> The accession of
the Latin dynasty to the throne of Constantinople
in this year was a serious hindrance to the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>employment
of sea-fire. The Latins were ignorant
of its composition, and they were not likely to gain
information upon the subject from the few Greeks
who were acquainted with it; for these Christians
did not love one another. Finally, saltpetre was
discovered not many years afterwards, and its substitution
for customary ingredients in the later
editions of existing “Fire-books”<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> proves that it
was utilised without delay for Greek fire, which
thus became a more formidable incendiary than
sea-fire.</p>

<p>The Greeks had no hand in the invention of
cannon. One of their historians of the fifteenth
century, when speculating on the subject in his
narrative for the year 1389, says the Germans were
commonly believed to have been the inventors.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
Could the Greeks, then, have been in possession
of saltpetre-mixtures many centuries before? Is it
credible that people with intellect as keen as the
Greeks employed an explosive for long ages without
hitting upon the idea of metal guns? Yet judging
from the manner in which Chalcocondyles speaks of
cannon in his narrative for 1446, they were even
then but little known to the Greeks. “Cannon,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>he tells his countrymen, “are formidable instruments,
which no armour can resist, and which
penetrates through everything.”<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> No historian of
the ability of Chalcocondyles would have spoken
in this manner about an arm which was well
known.</p>

<p>The fact that the first recorded use of fire-arrows
on Greek soil was made by Persian archers,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> lends
some probability to the view that Greek fire was
originally borrowed from the East; but the Greeks
assuredly invented the sea-fire which was the palladium
of the Empire for several centuries. To the
discovery of saltpetre they have no legitimate claim.
The claim put forward in their name is based partly
on a metaphor,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> partly on the assumption that the
effects of sea-fire could have been only produced by
a mixture containing saltpetre; and it cannot be
sustained. The hypothesis that Kallinikos compounded
a saltpetre mixture ignores the highly
probable conclusion that saltpetre was not discovered
until the thirteenth century;<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> fails to
explain some statements, and is irreconcilable with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>other statements made by the ancients; and involves
many incredible consequences.</p>

<p>It may be objected that this conclusion has been
arrived at without taking the evidence of the chief
witness for the Greeks, Marcus Græcus. Let us
examine his <cite>Liber Ignium</cite>.</p>

<p class="indent4 f08">Incipit Liber Ignium a Marco Græco descriptus,
cuius virtus et efficacia ad comburendos hostes tam
in mari quam in terra plurimum efficax reperitur;
quorum primus hic est.</p>

<p>1. Recipe sandaracæ puræ libram I., armoniaci
liquidi ana. Haec simul pista et in vase fictili
vitreato et luto sapientiæ diligenter obturato
deinde (?); donec liquescat ignis subponatur. Liquoris
vero istius haec sunt signa, ut ligno intromisso
per foramen ad modum butyri videatur. Postea
vero IV. libras de alkitran græco infundas. Haec
autem sub tecto fieri prohibeantur, quum periculum
immineret. Cum autem in mari ex ipso operari
volueris, de pelle caprina accipies utrem, et in ipsum
de hoc oleo libras II. intromittas. Si hostes prope
fuerint, intromittes minus, si vero remoti fuerint,
plus mittes. Postea vero utrem ad veru ferreum
ligabis, lignum adversus veru grossitudinem faciens.
Ipsum veru inferius sepo perungues, lignum prædictum
in ripa succendes, et sub utre locabis. Tunc
vero oleum sub veru et super lignum distillans accen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>sum
super aquas discurret, et quidquid obviam fuerit
concremabit.</p>

<p>2. Et sequitur alia species ignis quæ comburit
domos inimicorum in montibus sitas, aut in aliis
locis, si libet. Recipe balsami sive petrolii libram I.,
medulæ cannæ ferulæ libras sex, sulphuris libram I.,
pinguedinis arietinæ liquefactæ libram I., et oleum
terebenthinæ sive de lateribus vel anethorum. Omnibus
his collectis sagittam quadrifidam faciens de
confectione prædicta replebis. Igne autem intus
reposito, in aërem cum arcu emittes; ibi enim sepo
liquefacto et confectione succensa, quocumque loco
cecidit, comburit illum; et si aqua superjecta fuerit,
augmentabitur flamma ignis.</p>

<p>3. Alius modus ignis ad comburendos hostes
ubique sitos. Recipe balsamum, oleum Æthiopiæ,
alkitran et oleum sulphuris. Haec quidem omnia
in vase fictili reposita in fimo diebus XIV. subfodias.
Quo inde extracto, corvos eodem perunguens ad
hostilia loca sive tentoria destinabis. Oriente enim
sole, ubicumque illud liquefactum fuerit, accendetur.
Unde semper ante solis ortum aut post occasum
ipsius præcipimus esse mittendos.</p>

<p>4. Oleum vero sulphuris sic fit. Recipe sulphuris
uncias quattuor, quibus in marmoreo lapide contritis
et in pulverum redactis, oleum iuniperi quattuor
uncias admisces et in caldario pone, ut, lento igne
supposito, destillare incipiat.</p>

<p>5. Modus autem ad idem. Recipe sulphuris
splendidi quattuor uncias, vitella ovorum quinquaginti
unum contrita, et in patella ferrea lento igne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
coquantur; et quum ardere inceperit, in altera parte
patellae declinans, quod liquidius emanabit, ipsum
est quod quæris, oleum scilicet sulphuricum.</p>

<p>6. Sequitur alia species ignis, cum qua, si opus,
subeas hostiles domus vicinas. Recipe alkitran, boni,
olei ovorum, sulphuris quod leviter frangitur ana
unciam unam. Quæ quidem omnia commisceantur.
Pista et ad prunas appone. Quum autem commixta
fuerint, ad collectionem totius confectionis
quartem partem ceræ novæ adicies, ut in modum
cataplasmatis convertatur. Quum autem operari
volueris, vesicam bovis vento repletam accipias et
in foramen in ea faciens cera supposita ipsam
obturabis. Vesica tali præscripta sæpissime oleo
peruncta cum ligno marubii, quod ad haec invenietur
aptius, accenso ac simul imposito, foramen aperies;
ea enim semel accensa et a filtro quo involuta fuerit
extracta, in ventosa nocti sub lecto vel tecto inimici
tui supponatur. Quocumque enim ventus eam
sufflaverit, quidquid propinquum fuerit, comburetur;
et si aqua projecta fuerit, letales procreabit flammas.</p>

<p>7.Sub pacis namque specie missis nuntiis, ad
loca hostilia bacleos gerentes excavos hac materia
repletos et confectione, qui jam prope hostes fuerint,
quo fungebuntur ignem jam per domos et vias
fundentes. Dum calor solis supervenerit, omnia
incendio comburentur.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p>Recipe sandaracae (libram, cerae)<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> libram: in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>vase vero fictili, ore concluso, liquescat. Quum
autem liquefacta fuerint, medietatem libræ olei lini
et sulphuris superadjicies. Quæ quidem omnia in
eodem vase tribus mensibus in fimo ovino reponantur,
verum tamen fimum ter in mense renovando.</p>

<p>8. Ignis quem invenit Aristoteles quum cum
Alexandro ad obscura loca iter ageret, volens in eo
per mensem fieri id quod sol in anno præparat. Ut
in spera de auricalco, recipe seris rubicundi libram I.,
stanni et plumbi, limaturæ ferri, singulorum medietatem
libræ. Quibus pariter liquefactis, ad modum
astrolabii lamina formetur lata et rotunda. Ipsam
eodem igne perunctam X. diebus siccabis, duodecies
iterando: per annum namque integrum ignis idem
succensus nullatenus deficiet. Quæ enim inunctio
ultra annum durabit. Si vero locum quempiam
inunguere libeat, eo desiccato, scintilla quælibet
diffusa ardebit continue, nec aqua extingui poterit.
Et haec est prædicti ignis compositio. Recipe
alkitran, colophonii, sulphuris crocei, olei ovorum
sulphurici. Sulphur in marmore teratur. Quo
facto universum oleum superponas. Deinde tectoris
limaginem ad omne pondus acceptum insimul pista
et inungue.</p>

<p>9. Et sequitur alia species ignis, quo Aristoteles
domos in montibus sitas destruere incendio ait, ut et
mons ipse subsideret. Recipe balsami libram I.,
alkitran libras V., oleum ovorum et calcis non
extinctae libras X. Calcem teras cum oleo donec
una fiat massa; deinde inunguas lapides ex ipso et
herbas ac renascentias quaslibet in diebus caniculari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>bus,
et sub fimo eiusdam regionis sub fossa dimittes;
postea<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> namque autumnalis pluviæ dilapsu succenditur.
Terram et indigenas comburit igne
Aristoteles, namque hunc ignem annis IX. durare
asserit.</p>

<p>10. Compositio inextinguibilis et experta. Accipe<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>
sulphur vivum, colophonium, asphaltum classam,
tartarum, piculam navalem, fimum ovinum aut
columbinum. Hæc pulverisa subtiliter petroleo;
postea in ampulla reponendo vitrea, orificio bene
clauso, per dies XV. in fimo calido equino subhumetur,
Extracta vero ampulla destillabis oleum in
cucurbita lento igne ac cinere mediante, calidissima
ac subtili. In quo si bombax intincta fuerit ac
accensa, omnia super quæ arcu vel ballista proiecta
fuerit, incendio concremabit.</p>

<p>11. Nota quod omnis ignis inextinguibilis IV.
rebus extingui vel suffocari poterit, videlicet cum
aceto acuto aut cum urina antiqua vel arena, sive
filtro ter in aceto imbibito et toties desiccato ignem
iam dictum suffocas.</p>

<p>12. Nota quod ignis volatilis in aëre duplex est
compositio; quorum primus est:&mdash;recipe partem
unam colophonii et tantum sulphuris vivi, II. partes
vero salis petrosi et in oleo linoso vel lamii<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> quod
est melius, dissolvantur bene pulverisata et oleo
liquefacta. Postea in canna vel ligno excavo re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>ponatur
et accendatur. Evolat enim subito ad
quemcumque locum volueris, et omnia incendio
concremabit.</p>

<p>13. Secundus modus ignis volatilis hoc modo
conficitur. Accipias libram I. sulphuris vivi, libras
duas carbonum vitis vel salicis, VI. libras salis
petrosi; quae tria subtilissima terantur in lapide
marmoreo. Postea pulvis ad libitum in tunica
reponatur volatili vel tonitrum faciente.</p>

<p>Nota, quod tunica ad volundum debet esse
gracilis et longa et cum prædicto pulvere optime
conculcato repleta. Tunica vero tonitrum faciens
debet esse brevis et grossa et prædicto pulvere semiplena
et ab utraque parte fortissime filo ferreo bene
ligata. Nota, quod in tali tunica parvum foramen
faciendum est, ut tenta imposita accendatur; quæ
tenta in extremitatibus sit gracilis, in medio vero
lata et prædicto pulvere repleta. Nota, quod quæ
ad volandum tunica, plicaturas ad libitum habere
potest; tonitrum vero faciens, quam plurimas plicaturas.
Nota, quod duplex poteris facere tonitrum
atque duplex volatile instrumentum, videlicet tunicam
includendo.</p>

<p>14. Nota, quod sal petrosum est minera terræ et
reperitur in scopulis et lapidibus.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> Haec terra dissolvatur
in aqua bulliente, postea depurata et
destillata per filtrum, permittatur per diem et noctem
integram decoqui; et invenies in fundo laminas
salis congelatas cristallinas.</p>

<p>15. Candela quæ, si semel accensa fuerit, non
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>amplius extinguitur. Si vero aqua irrigata fuerit,
maius parabit incendium. Formetur sphaera de ære
Italico; deinde accipies calcis vivæ partem unam,
galbani mediam et cum felle testudinis ad pondus
galbani sumpto conficies. Postea cantharides quot
volueris accipies, capitibus et alis abscisis, cum
aequali parte olei zambac, teras et in vase fictili
reposita, XI. diebus sub fimo equino reponantur, de
quinto in quintum diem fimum renovando. Sic olei
foetidi et crocei spiritum assument, de quo sphæram
illinias; qua siccata, sepo inguatur, post igne
accendatur.</p>

<p>16. Alia candela que continuum præstat incendium.
Vermes noctilucas cum oleo zambac puro
teres et in rotunda ponas vitrea, orificio lutato cera
Græca et sale combusto bene recluso et in fimo, ut
iam dictum est, equino reponenda. Quo soluto,
sphæram de ferro Indico vel auricalco undique cum
penna illinias; quæ his iuncta et dessiccata igne
succendatur et nunquam deficiet. Si vero attingit
pluvia, majus præstat incendii incrementum.</p>

<p>17. Alia quæ semel incensa dat lumen diuturnum.
Recipe noctilucas quum incipiunt volare, et cum
æquali parte olei zambac commixta, XIV. diebus
sub fimo fodias equino. Quo inde extracto, ad
quartam partem istius assumas felles testudinis, ad
sex felles mustelæ, ad medietatem fellis furonis. In
fimo repone, ut iam dictum est. Deinde exhibe in
quolibet vase lichnum, cujuscumque generis, pone
de ligno aut latone vel ferro vel ære. Ea tandem
hoc oleo peruncta et accensa diuturnum præstat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>cendium.
Haec autem opera prodigiosa et admiranda
Hermes et Tholomeus<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> asserunt.</p>

<p>18. Hoc autem genus candelæ neque in domo
clausa nec aperta neque in aqua extingui poterit.
Quod est: recipe fel testudinis, fel marini leporis
sive lupi aquatici de cuius felle Tyriaca. Quibus
insimul collectis quadrupliciter noctilucarum capitibus
ac alis præcisis adicies, totumque in vase
plumbeo vel vitreo repositum in fimo subfodias
equino, ut dictum est, quod extractum oleum recipias.
Verum tum cum æquali parte prædictorum
fellium et æquali noctilucarum admiscens, sub fimo
XI. diebus subfodias per singulares hebdomades
fimum renovando; quo iam extracto de radice herbæ
que cyrogaleonis<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> et noctilucis pabulum factum, ex
hoc liquore medium superfundas. Quod si volueris,
omnia repone in vase vitreo et eodem ordine fit.
Quolibet enim loco repositum fuerit, continuum
præstat incendium.</p>

<p>19. Candela quæ in domo relucet ut argentum.
Recipe lacertam nigram vel viridem, cuius caudam
amputa et desicca; nam in cauda eius argenti vivi
silicem reperies. Deinde quodcumque lichnum in
illo illinitum ac involutum in lampade locabis vitrea
aut ferrea, qua accensa mox domus argenteum induet
colorem, et quicumque in domo illa erit, ad modum
argenti relucebit.</p>

<p>20. Ut domus quælibet viridem induat colorem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>et aviculæ coloris ejusdem volent. Recipe cerebrum
aviculæ in panno involvens tentam et baculum, inde
faciens vel pabulum in lampade viridi novo oleo
olivarum accendatur.</p>

<p>21. Ut ignem manibus gestare possis sine ulla
læsione. Cum aqua fabarum calida calx dissolvatur,
modicum terræ Messinæ, postea parum malvæ visci
adicies. Quibus insimul commixtis palmam illinias
et desiccari permittas.</p>

<p>22. Ut aliquis sine læsione comburi videatur.
Alceam cum albumine ovorum confice, et corpus
perungue et desiccari permitte. Deinde coque cum
vitellis ovorum iterum, commiscens terendo super
pannum lineum. Postea sulphur pulverisatum superaspergens
accende.</p>

<p>23. Candela quæ, quum aliquis in manibus
apertis tenuerit, cito extinguitur; si vero clausis,
ignis subito renitebitur: et haec millies, si vis,
poteris facere. Recipe nucem Indicam vel castaneam,
eam aqua camphoræ conficias, et manus cum
eo inungue, et fiet confestim.</p>

<p>24. Confectio visci est cum si aqua projecta
fuerit, accendetur ex toto. Recipe calcem vivam,
eamque cum modico gummi Arabici et oleo in vase
candido cum sulphure confice; ex quo factum viscum
et aqua aspersa accendetur. Hac vero confectione
domus quælibet adveniente pluvia accendetur.</p>

<p>25. Lapis qui dicitur petra solis in domo
locandus, et appositus lapidi qui dicitur albacarimum
(<cite>alba ceraunia?</cite>). Lapis quidem niger est<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
et rotundus, candidas vero habens notas, ex quo
vero lux solaris serenissimus procedit radius. Quem
si in domo dimiseris, non minor quam ex candelis
cereis splendor procedit. Hic in loco sublimi positus
et aqua compositus relucet valde.</p>

<p>26. Ignem Græcum tali modo facies. Recipe
sulphur vivum, tartarum, sarcocollam et picem, sal
coctum, oleum petroleum et oleum gemmæ. Facias
bullire invicem omnia ista bene. Postea impone
stuppam et accende, quod, si volueris, exhibere
(poteris ?) per embotum ut supra diximus.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> Stuppa
illinita non extinguetur, nisi urina vel aceto vel
arena.</p>

<p>27. Aquam ardentem sic facies. Recipe vinum
nigrum spissum et vetus et in una quarta ipsius distemperabuntur
unciæ II. sulphuris vivi subtilissime
pulverisati, lib. II. tartari extracti a bono vino albo,
unciæ II. salis communis; et subdita ponas in
cucurbita bene plumbata et alembico supposito
destillabis aquam ardentem quam servare debes in
vase clauso vitreo.</p>

<p>28. Experimentum mirabile quod fecit homines
ire in igne sini læsione vel etiam portare ignem vel
ferrum calidum in manu. Recipe succum bisvalvæ
et albumen ovi et semen psillii et calcem et pulverisa;
et confice cum albumine succis (?) raphani
et commisce. Et ex hac commixtione illinias corpus
tuum et manum et desiccare permitte et post iterum
illinias; et tunc poteris audacter sustinere sine
nocumento.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>
<p>29. Si autem velis ut videatur comburi, tunc
accenditur sulphur, nec nocebit ei.</p>

<p>30. Candela accensa quæ tantam reddit flammam
quæ crines vel vestes tenentis eam comburit.
Recipe terebenthinam et destilla per alembicum
aquam ardentem, quam impones in vino cui applicatur
candela et ardebit ipsa.</p>

<p>31. Recipe colophonium et picem subtilissime
tritum et ibi cum tunica proicies in ignem vel in
flammam candelæ.</p>

<p>32. Ignis volantis in aëre triplex est compositio.
Quorum primus fit de sale petroso et sulphure et
oleo lini, quibus tritis, distemperatis et in canna
positis et accensis, poterit in aërem sufflari.</p>

<p>33. Alius ignis volans in aëre fit ex sale petroso
et sulphure vivo et ex carbonibus vitis vel salicis;
quibus mixtis et in tenta de papiro facta positis et
accensis, mox in aërem volat. Et nota, quod respectu
sulphuris debes ponere tres partes de carbonibus, et
respectu carbonum tres partes salpetræ.</p>

<p>34. Carbunculum gemmæ lumen præstantem
sic facies. Recipe noctilucas quam plurimas; ipsas
conteras in ampulla vitrea et in fimo equino calido
sepelias et permorari permittas per XV. dies. Postea
ipsas remotas destillabis per alembicum et ipsam
aquam in cristallo reponas concavo.</p>

<p>35. Candela durabilis maxime ingeniosa fit. Fiat
archa plumbea vel ænea omnino plena intus et in
fundo locetur canale gracile tendens ad candelabrum,
et præstabit lumen continuum oleo durante.</p>

<p>M. Berthelot (i. 100 <i>ff.</i>) gives the best existing
text of the foregoing tract, founded on Paris MSS.
7156 and 7158 collated with the Munich MS. 267.
He adds extracts from the Munich MS. 197, dated
1438. Herr von Romocki gives the text reproduced
here and the Nürnberg MS. of a somewhat later date
than the Paris MSS., say 1350.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>A glance at the text given here shows that, far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>from being a formal and connected treatise, it is a
medley of recipes thrown together with very little
method and without any literary skill. Of the
thirty-five recipes (in Du Theil’s MS.) fourteen are
war mixtures, six relate to the extinction of incendiaries
or the prevention and cure of burns, eleven are
for lamps, lights, &amp;c., and four describe the preparation
of certain chemicals&mdash;one of them, No. 14, giving
a mode of refining saltpetre. The war mixtures
consist of nine recipes for various fires, Nos. 1, 2, 3,
6, 7, 8, 9, 24, and 26; one for fire-arrow composition,
No. 10; and four for rockets and Roman
candles (including a “cracker”), Nos. 12, 13, 32,
and 33. Nos. 9, 15, and 24 contain quicklime; 12,
13, 14, 32, and 33 contain saltpetre.</p>

<p>A closer examination leads to the conclusion
that the tract is the work of neither one author nor
one period. As we read of such ingredients as
weasel’s gall (17) and paste of glow-worms (16); of
the mercury to be found in black and green lizards’
tails (19); of the mixture which ignites incontinently
at sunrise, wherewith crows are to be anointed and
despatched against the enemy (3), we seem to hear
the chant of the witches in “Macbeth”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Eye of newt and toe of frog,</div>
<div class="line">Wool of bat and tongue of dog,</div>
<div class="line">Adder’s fork and blind-worm’s sting,</div>
<div class="line">Lizard’s leg and owlet’s wing.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>These recipes embody the same traditions as the
war recipes of the “Kestoi” of Sextus Julius Afri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>canus,
which belong to the seventh century. But
on turning to Nos. 32 and 33, we find recipes as
precise and formal as those of Hassan er-Rammah,
who wrote in the last quarter of the thirteenth
century. The description of the rocket and its
composition (13) is as definite and intelligible as
many a recipe of the seventeenth century: recipes
8 and 17, with their allusions to Hermes, the mythical
Alexander the Great, Aristotle the wizard and
Ptolemy the magician, belong to a far earlier period.
In short, the extraordinary contrast in style and
matter, phraseology and diction, between certain
recipes and others, leads irresistibly to the conclusion
that the oldest recipes are separated from the
youngest by several centuries, and that the tract
(as we possess it) was not the work of one man,
but of several. There is a kernel of old recipes,
to which others were added from time to time.
This conclusion receives strong support from the
fact that no two of the MSS. are of the same
length. The Munich MS. contains twenty-two,
Berthelot’s text thirty-five, and the Nürnberg MS.
twenty-five recipes.</p>

<p>The best judges date the oldest existing MSS.,
Paris, 7156 and 7158, at about 1300 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, and Abd
Allah tells us that saltpetre was known to the
Spanish Arabs in the second quarter of the thirteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> The saltpetre recipes, therefore,
12, 13, 14, 32, 33, lie between the years 1225 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>1300. We shall call them, for convenience of reference,
the “Late Recipes.”</p>

<p>No one who carefully studies the remaining
recipes can fail to observe that many of them are
marked by archaism of style, form and matter, and
that they hand down to us ancient alchemical traditions,
or traces of them; while others display no
such peculiarities. Let us then, again for mere
convenience, divide them into two series&mdash;the
“Early Recipes,” which possess these peculiarities,
and the “Middle Recipes,” which do not. To
what periods do these two series belong?</p>

<p>No. 26, apparently the most modern of the
Middle Recipes, will presently be shown to belong
to the early part of the thirteenth century, and, as
it does not contain saltpetre, its approximate date
is 1200-1225. There is no evidence, so far as I
am aware, which would enable us to fix the beginning
of the Middle or the end of the Early
Recipes. The matter, happily, is immaterial; it is
sufficient for us to know that the former series is
undoubtedly subsequent to the latter, and (as will
be shown) quite independent of it.</p>

<p>For a reason which will appear presently, the
date of the oldest of the Early Recipes depends
upon the period at which Moslems began to write
upon alchemy. According to Arab authorities,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> the
first Moslem who wrote on the subject was Prince
Khalid ibn Yazeed ibn Moawyah, who died in 708.
After him came the real Jabir, of the eighth or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>ninth century; but Masudi, in the tenth century,
tells us that there were many other writers on
alchemy whose names are now lost.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> The very
earliest date, then, that can be assigned to the
oldest of the Early Recipes is the eighth century,
say 750.</p>

<p>Looking from the chemical point of view, M.
Berthelot divides the recipes into six groups.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
Those who are interested in the matter will find
on examination that, chronologically, his groups
harmonise perfectly with the three series given
here.</p>

<p>The reader will observe on a cursory examination
of the Latin text that most of the recipes
contain foreign, <i>i.e.</i> non-Latin words; and this fact
suggests the question, Is the <cite>Liber Ignium</cite> an
original work or a translation?</p>

<p>The number of foreign words and allusions is
so considerable as to leave little doubt that a large
part of the tract was translated from some foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>language, and no one, I believe, seriously maintains
that the work, as a whole, is original. From what
language, then, has it been translated?</p>

<p>We meet with the Greek proper names Hermes,
Ptolemy, Alexander and Aristotle, and with a
number of Greek words which look like survivals
of a Greek original. Among the most prominent
are alba ceraunia (?), asphaltum,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> bombax, cynoglossum (?),
orichalcum and sarcocolla, all of which are
latinised Greek words. But on looking closely into
this evidence we find that it has very little weight.
The Greek proper names prove nothing. Hermes
and Ptolemy became common property to alchemists
of all nationalities in the infancy of alchemy.
Alexander the Great’s extraordinary career excited
universal wonder, and the many and marvellous
legends which grew round his name in the West
were only surpassed by those of the East. He
and his Wazir, Aristu (Aristotle), were common
property long before the <cite>Liber Ignium</cite> saw the
light. The Greek words give no support to the
hypothesis of a Greek original unless it can be
shown either that they had not previously been
adopted by the Latins, or that the tract was written
before they were borrowed. A particular instance
will make the matter clearer. We took the word
<em>harquebus</em> from the French at some period, say <em>p</em>.
If harquebus occurs in an English book written
after <em>p</em>, its presence raises no presumption that
the book was in any way connected with France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>or even that its author understood French. If
the book was written before <em>p</em>, its author
must have had recourse, directly or indirectly, to
French sources. Now all the Greek words given
above had been latinised long before the <cite>Liber
Ignium</cite> was written, and might have been used
by a Latin when translating from any language.
Alba ceraunia, asphaltum, bombax, cynoglossum and
sarcocolla are found in Pliny’s “Natural History,”
first century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, and orichalcum occurs in the
“Bragging Soldier” of Plautus about the end of
the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> But it is unnecessary to
continue the examination of the Greek words contained
in the tract for the following reason. A
hypothesis must cover all the facts of a case, and
some facts in the present case are inexplicable on
the theory of a Greek original.</p>

<p>The Greeks had three words for the asphalt
family, <em>pissa</em>, <em>asphaltos</em>, and <em>naphtha</em>; and the
translator had at least three Latin words (which
he has actually used) wherewith to translate them,
<em>pix</em> (or <em>picula</em>), <em>asphaltum</em>, and <em>petroleum</em>. How,
then, came he to use the barbarism, <em>alkitran Græcum</em>,
in recipe 1? The original of this phrase came from
no Greek source.</p>

<p>We could not expect the author of the tract to
reveal the secret of the sea-fire, which was only
known to a few officials; but the mediæval Greeks
were not an exceptionally modest people, and we
naturally look for some slight allusion to this
triumphant incendiary and the siphons in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
it was employed. They are never referred to,
although ballistæ, bows, and rockets are mentioned
in recipes 10, 12, 13, 32, 33.</p>

<p>The title of the tract, <cite>Liber Ignium, a Marco
Græco descriptus</cite>, assuming it to have been correctly
and literally translated, was not written by a Byzantine
Greek. No Byzantine Greek ever described
himself (or a compatriot) as a Greek: “in the lowest
period of degeneracy and decay the name of <em>Roman</em>
adhered to the last fragments of the Empire of
Constantinople.”<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> The writer of the title, therefore,
was either a Moslem or a western.</p>

<p>The author of recipe 26, <cite>Ignem Græcum</cite>, &amp;c.,
was neither a Greek nor a Moslem. No Greek<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> or
Moslem<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> writer ever uses the phrase “Greek fire,”
which sprang up in the West during the Crusades.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
The recipe, therefore, cannot have been written
before the siege of Nice, 1097, the first act of the
first crusade, and it was probably not written until
long afterwards. The phrase “Greek fire” must have
taken some time to reach the West, and it spread
there very slowly. Abbé Guibert de Nogent, who
died in 1124, speaks of “discharging from machines
the fire they call Greek” (<cite>Græcos, quos ita vocitant,
Ignes injicere machinis</cite>).<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> At the close of the century
William the Little, Canon of St. Mary’s, Newburgh,
Yorkshire, mentions “a certain kind of fire
which they call Greek “ (<cite>quodam ignis genere quem</cite>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span><cite>Græcum dicunt</cite>)<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> Such modes of expression show
that Greek fire was very little known in the West
during the twelfth century. In the <cite>Liber Ignium</cite>,
on the other hand, it is spoken of without qualification
or explanation, like sulphur or pitch, as a
substance too well known to require note or comment.
The 26th recipe, therefore, belongs very
probably to the first quarter of the thirteenth century,
and its author was certainly a western.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of a Greek original, then, must
be abandoned, even though old Greek alchemical
traditions are crystallised in the Early Recipes.
The Greeks founded alchemy in remote times;
their methods were transmitted through the Syrians
and Egyptian Greeks to the Moslems; and a large
number of their recipes had become common property
long before the <cite>Liber Ignium</cite> was written.
But Greek science did not spread equally in all
directions, at least to any appreciable extent. It
spread to the south and east only, and the west
owed its knowledge of alchemy to the Arabs who
invaded Spain in 710 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> This fact may throw
some light upon the Arabic words and allusions to
be found in the tract.</p>

<p>In a very old recipe, No. 9, we meet with the
phrase, “the first fall of the autumnal rain “ (<cite>primo
autumnalis pluviae dilapsu</cite>), which indicates the
regular, periodic rains of the East, and is apparently
the translation of خريف (kharif) = the autumnal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>rains. The beginning of these rains was an event of
great importance to the Arabs. “Suivant Masudi,”
says Baron de Sacy, “les Arabes nomment l’automne
وسمي (<em>wasmy</em>), à cause des pluies qui tombent en
cette saison, parceque la terre, étant alors très-sèche,
et n’ayant pas été humectée depuis longtemps, la
première pluie qui vient à tomber imprime sa marque
sur la terre.... Il ajoute que les Arabes commencent
l’année à l’équinoxe d’automne, parceque
c’est l’époque où commence à tomber la pluie à
laquelle ils doivent leur subsistance.”<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p><em>Alambicum</em> is apparently the latinised form of
the Spanish <em>alambique</em>, which is simply the Arabic
الانبيق (<em>al-ambiq</em>)&mdash;whatever the derivation of the
Arabic word may be.</p>

<p>استرلاب (<em>Asturlab</em>), although found in Masudi<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a>
and the “Arabian Nights,”<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> is not a genuine Arab
word. It was borrowed from some other language
by the Arabs, who possessed few or no scientific
words of their own. The “Nihayet al-Adab” tells
us (in Lane’s “Arabic Dictionary,” under <em>asturlab</em>)
that the names of all instruments by which time is
known, whether by means of calculation or water
or sand, are foreign to the Arabic language. In
most Arabic dictionaries <em>asturlab</em> is derived from
the Greek ἀστρολάβος, a word which appears to go
back no further than the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>it was employed by the Egyptian astronomer,
Ptolemy. But it was long suspected that the instrument
was of eastern origin,<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> and all doubt about
the matter was at length set at rest by Mr. George
Smith’s discovery, in the palace of Sennacherib at
Nineveh, of the fragment of an astrolabe,<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> which
cannot be dated later than the eighth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
Now the earliest recorded astronomical observation
made by the Greeks was the determination of the
summer solstice by Meton, 430 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> For the name
of this fragment, therefore, we must look to the
language of the country of its birth; and there
we find the Persian <em>asturlab</em>, which is apparently
formed from the primitive verbal root <em>labh</em> = taking,<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>
and the Persian <em>astar</em> or <em>sitára</em> = Pehlevi, <em>çtârak</em> =
Zend, <em>çtare</em> = Sanskrit, <em>star</em> = our own <em>star</em>. The
Arabs most probably took their <em>asturlab</em>, with so
many other words, from the Persian. The Greeks
who followed Alexander the Great into Persia
found there much that was new to them. They
saw for the first time “the cotton tree and the
fine tissues and paper for which it furnished the
materials.”<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> They handled the wool of the great
Bombax tree. They found naphtha, of whose properties
Alexander was entirely ignorant.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>obtained drugs and gums of which they knew
nothing. The philosopher Kallisthenes discovered
in Babylon Chaldæan astronomical observations extending
back to 721 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>;<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> was shown, we cannot
doubt, the instrument with which they were made;
and probably heard for the first time the word
<em>asturlab</em> or <em>usturlab</em>.</p>

<p>For copper (or some alloy of it<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a>) the <em>cyprium</em> of
Pliny (which became <em>cuprum</em> about the end of the
third century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>) is ignored in the tract, and the
metal is called <em>æs rubicundus</em>. This phrase may
possibly represent the χαλκὸς ἐρυθρός of Homer (Il.
ix. 365); but it is far more probably the literal
translation of the Arabic phrase used to this day
for copper نحاس احمر (<em>nuhas ahmar</em>) = red brass.</p>

<p>Four (so-called) sulphurs are mentioned by both
Pliny and the writers of the <cite>Liber Ignium</cite>, but their
names are identical in only one case, <em>sulphur vivum</em>.
Two sulphurs are named in the tract from their
colour, after the oriental fashion, <em>sulphur splendidum</em>
and <em>sulphur croceum</em>. Masudi speaks in the tenth
century of “white, yellow, and other kinds of sulphur,”<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>
and “white and red sulphur” are mentioned
in the <cite>Ayin Acberi</cite>, a Persian MS. quoted by the
Baron de Sacy.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> Several sulphurs, all named from
their colour, are given in the <cite>Liber Secretorum</cite>,
translated from the Arabic or Persian, <i>cir.</i> 1000 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>and similar sulphurs are found in the Syriac treatise
reproduced by M. Berthelot, ii. 159-60. Finally,
the Hindus had four sulphurs, white, red, yellow,
and black.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p>The Arabs had no special word for bitumen:
<em>bitumen</em> is not to be found in the tract.</p>

<p><em>Alkitran</em>, the Spanish <em>alquitran</em>, which is used
five times, is pure Arabic, القطران (<em>al-qitran</em>).</p>

<p>In three successive recipes we meet an Arabic
word in its native form, without any attempt
to translate it&mdash;زنبق (<em>zembaq</em>). Its meaning is
doubtful, for a reason given by Baron de Sacy:
“Le nom zambak est commun à plusieurs plantes.
Forskål le donne à <em>l’iris</em> et au <em>lis blanc</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>We have already met with two Arabic words
which were adopted unchanged, and are still used,
by the Spaniards, alembic and alkitran. There are
other traces of Spain.</p>

<p>Roger Bacon observes in his “Greek Grammar”
(p. 92) that the alloy <em>auricalcum</em> is in no way connected
with <em>aurum</em>, gold, but is a corruption of
<em>orichalcum</em>. The Spaniards, however, retained in
their language the corrupt form auricalco, and auricalcum
occurs twice in the tract.</p>

<p>We may gather from Lebrixa’s explanation of
“bitumen Judaicum”&mdash;“est quod græce dicitur
asphaltos”<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>&mdash;that the Spaniards had no special word
for asphalt; <em>asphaltum</em> is used only once in the tract,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>recipe 10. But they used <em>petroleo</em> for petroleum;<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
<em>petroleum</em> is found in recipes 2, 10, and 26. This word,
in the form <em>petra oleum</em>, is used in the Anglo-Saxon
“Leechdoms,” published in the Rolls Series, which
Rev. O. Cockayne, the editor, dates at 900; ii. 289.
The Spaniards did not use the word <em>naphtha</em>, which is
described by Lebrixa as “el fuego como de alquitran.”
<em>Naphtha</em> does not occur in the tract, although
it is found in Latin and Greek authors of the first
and second centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>; in Pliny’s “Natural
History,” ii. 109 (105); in Dioskorides, i. 101;
and in Plutarch’s “Alexander,” 35. It appears as
<em>naphathe</em> in the “Speculum” of Vincentius Bellovacensis,
1228; <i>l.</i> i. <i>c.</i> 92. The commonest Spanish
word for one or other of the asphalt family, <em>alquitran</em>,
occurs (as before mentioned) five times in the
tract.</p>

<p>On referring to the Chemical Index, p. 68, it will
be found that all the foregoing Arabic and Spanish
words occur in the Early Recipes. The Middle
Recipes contain only one Arabic word, <em>alambic</em>,
recipes 27 and 30, which is also found in the Early
Recipes, No. 34; and one Spanish word, <em>petroleo</em>,
recipe 26, which occurs twice in the earlier series,
Nos. 2 and 10. Now, Spain was the only European
country in which Arabic was understood during the
Middle Ages. “In all Europe, outside Spain, but
three isolated Arabists of that time are known&mdash;William
of Tyre, Philip of Tripoli, and Adelard of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>Bath.”<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> Pagnino printed an edition of the Qur’an
at Venice in 1530, and it was immediately suppressed
by the Church; “a precaution hardly required,”
says Hallam, “while there was no one able to read
it.”<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> Furthermore, we know that a series of Latin
translations of Hebrew and Arabic MSS. were
made in Spain between the years 1182 and 1350.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a>
We may therefore conclude with some little probability:&mdash;</p>

<p>1°. That the Early Recipes were translated from
a lost Arabic original.</p>

<p>2°. That the translator was a Spaniard.</p>

<p>3°. That the translation was made between the
years 1182 and 1225.</p>

<p>4°. That to this translation were added by other
hands, before 1225, the Middle Recipes, which
practically contain neither Hispanicism nor Arabism,
and which make no mention of saltpetre.</p>

<p>5°. That the Late Recipes were inserted towards
the close of the thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p>On accepting these conclusions, the difficulties
raised by the hypothesis of a Greek original vanish.
The Spanish translator had no need to translate the
<em>alkitran</em> of the Arabic writer, for the word was
Spanish as well as Arabic. Like all westerns, he
called the Byzantines Greeks, and a certain incendiary
Greek fire. Neither Moslem nor Spaniard was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>likely to speak of the sea-fire. Moslems would be
loth to recall the disasters at Cyzicus and elsewhere,
when this incendiary made havoc of their ships;
Spaniards knew nothing about it. Owing to the
secrecy maintained by the Imperial Government,
westerns knew very little about Byzantine pyrotechnics.
“At the end of the eleventh century the
Pisans ... suffered the effects, without understanding
the cause, of the Greek fire.”<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> The Princess
Anna Comnena ascribes the defeat of the Pisans in
a naval battle fought in 1103, to an unknown
incendiary employed by the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> In both cases
the incendiary could only have been the sea-fire, for
the Latins had been acquainted with ordinary incendiaries
for a thousand years. As late as 1204, the
Emperor Baldwin I., in a manifesto to all Christians,
declares that the Greeks used “machines and defences
to protect their capital (in this year) which
no one (from the West) had ever seen before.”<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>It is time to inquire who was Marcus Græcus.
He has been fancifully identified with many of the
Marci of history and fable, and M. Dutens discovered
him in the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> The views of M.
Dutens must be noticed here, because they have
been unwarily adopted by some good writers.</p>

<p>There exists a Latin translation of a lost Arabic
treatise on medicine, <cite>De Simplicibus</cite>, supposed by
some to have been written by Masawyah of Damas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>cus
in the eleventh century,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> while others, with M.
Dutens, assign it to Yahya ibn Masawyah, who
attended the Caliph Mamoun on his deathbed,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
833 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> The question before us is, does the <cite>De
Simplicibus</cite> (whatever its date) contain any reference
to Marcus? When mentioning the use of syrup of
cyclamen, Masawyah quotes the opinions of other
physicians: “The son of Serapion said (so and so) ... and
a Greek (physician) says (so and so)”
(<cite>dixit filius Serapionis ... et dicit Græcus</cite>).<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> On
the last two words, <em>dicit Græcus</em>, M. Dutens builds
his theory that the Greek physician was no other
than Marcus: “Ce qui paroît fort probable, est
que (Marcus Græcus) devoit vivre avant le médicin
arabe, Mesué, qui a paru au commencement du
neuvième siècle, puisque celui-ci le cite.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> By
this mode of reasoning, which is generally called
“begging the question,” Marcus Græcus may be
identified at will with any Greek who ever lived.
M. Dutens continues: “Fabricius croit que (Mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>cus
Græcus) est le même dont Galen parle dans un
endroit de ses ouvrages, au quel cas il serait du
temps requis pour appuyer mon sentiment.” It
would be strange indeed to find mention of a Latin
writer or book in a <cite>Bibliotheca Græca</cite>, and I have
failed to verify M. Dutens’ reference. In the editions
of Fabricius’ work which I have consulted he
expresses no such belief, nor does he allude to
Marcus Græcus. In the list Fabricius gives of
ancient physicians there are several who bear the
name of Marcus, but no Marcus Græcus. The last
of these Marci happens to be simply called “Marcus,”
and of him Fabricius says: “This Marcus,
who is mentioned by Galen in his book on compounding
medicines, may possibly have been one of
the foregoing” (<cite>Marcus, simpliciter, Galeno in compositionibus
medicamentorum</cite> κατὰ τόπους, <i>l.</i> iv. <i>c.</i> 7,
<cite>quem credibile fuisse unum ex illis prioribus</cite>).<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>The <cite>Liber Ignium</cite> was written from first to last
in the period of literary forgeries and pseudographs,
which produced the “Book of Hermes,” “The
Domestic Chemistry of Moses,” the alchemical works
of Plato and of Aristotle and of the Emperor Justinian,
and so on; and we may reasonably conclude
that Marcus Græcus is as unreal as the imaginary
Greek original of the tract which bears his name.</p>

<p>Had the last editor of the <cite>Liber Ignium</cite>, who
added the saltpetre receipts, any knowledge of an
explosive?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>We need not linger over the Roman candle of
No. 12, or the rocket of No. 13: had their charges
been explosive there would have been an end of the
candle and rocket, and of the men who fired them.
The cracker of No. 13 was a toy intended to “go off
with a bang,” without hurt to the bystanders. The
case was to be as strong as possible and securely
fastened at both ends with iron wires. It was to be
half filled with rocket composition, a mixture which
burned in a cracker-case precisely as it burned in
a rocket-case&mdash;with progressive combustion. Now
Roger Bacon had a similar toy, constructed with the
very same object, <i>i.e.</i> “to go off with a bang,” the
case of which was “merely a bit of paper.” Why
was there this marked difference, then, between the
two cases? Because the noise was produced in the
one by the explosion of the charge and in the other
by the rupture of the case. Bacon’s charge (as will
be shown in Chap. viii.) was gunpowder, and the
required “bang” was directly produced by its explosion.
Marcus’ toy was charged with an incendiary,
the combustion of which did not produce a “bang”
directly, but which produced one indirectly by ultimately
bursting open the thick, stout case. The
gases generated by its combustion “gradually developed
until the case burst,”<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> just as a bladder
bursts “with a bang” when over-inflated. Had
Bacon’s toy been charged with an incendiary, the
case, which was only a sheet of paper, would have
been set on fire by the heated gases long before their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>pressure had reached the bursting point, and there
would have been no “bang.” Had Marcus’ toy
been charged with an explosive, it would have
exploded destructively, and what was intended for a
public diversion would have proved a common
danger, owing to the thickness of the case and the
iron wire coiled round it. There is nothing in the
tract to show that its authors had any notion of
explosives, and their silence, without any assignable
motive, is strong evidence that they knew nothing
about them. It is incredible that pyrotechnists who
seldom omit to call attention to the effects of their
incendiaries,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> should have failed to make some allusion
to explosives if they possessed them. Their
silence was not owing to fear of the Church, for the
decree of the Second Council of the Lateran was
directed against the very mixtures which form the
staple of the <cite>Liber Ignium</cite>, incendiaries.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> The 12th
and 13th recipes contain the ingredients of the
future gunpowder; they form the last link in the
long chain of evolution which connects the incendiaries
of primitive times with gunpowder; but they
were not gunpowder, because they did not explode.
The chrysalis, we know, will become a butterfly if it
lives; nevertheless it would be an abuse of language
and a misrepresentation of fact to call it a butterfly.</p>

<p>The reader can now appreciate the value of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>the argument that the Greeks possessed an explosive
between the seventh and thirteenth centuries,
<em>because</em> Marcus Græcus describes one; and he can
understand why Marcus was not summoned in
Chap. iii. to give evidence for the Greeks.</p>

<p>A suspicion may be raised by the Arabic origin
of the <cite>Liber Ignium</cite>, that the people who approached
so nearly to the manufacture of gunpowder
may have ultimately reached it. We pass, therefore,
to a consideration of Arabic incendiaries in the
following chapter.</p>

<small><small>THE ARABS</small></small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Although</span> the Arabs had had relations with the
Greeks, Romans, and Persians for centuries, and
were acquainted with the details of the siege of
Jerusalem, 70 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, the earliest allusion to their use
of machines is the tradition that Jodhaimah, King
of Heerah, constructed manjánik in the third century
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span><a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> The scarcity of timber in Arabia may
partially explain the lateness of their introduction,
and the position of Heerah, in the north-east province
of Arabian Irak, raises a suspicion that the
Arabs learned the use of machines from the
Persians, who got them from the Greeks.</p>

<p>When the Prophet besieged Tayif in 8 <span class="smcap">A.H.</span>
(630 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>), the defenders had recourse to heated
projectiles.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> We may safely assume that they were
the balls of hot clay spoken of in the 11nth Sura
of the Qur’an, in describing the destruction of the
Cities of the Plain: “we rained upon them stones
of baked clay.”<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> Half a century afterwards, 683,
during the siege of Mecca, the Ka’aba was burned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>down by incendiary compositions, discharged, not by
Arabs, but by Syrians, who doubtless understood
the manipulation of naphtha and the other combustibles
used.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> In 712 the howdah in which sat
Dahir, King of Alor in Scinde, was set on fire by a
fire-arrow shot by a Moslem naphtha-thrower<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a>&mdash;the
same nature of projectile that had been used by the
Persian archers at the taking of Athens, 480 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
In speaking of the capture of Alor, both Mir
Ma’sum Bhakkari, in his “History of Scinde,” and
Haidar Razi, in his “General History,” mention the
employment of <em>atish bazi</em>, or fire-throwing machines,
“which the Moslems had seen in use with the
Greeks and Persians.”<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> Stones were discharged
from machines to so little purpose at the siege of
Heraclea, 805, that Harun er-Reshid urged his
generals to fasten incendiaries to them. This was
done with such effect that the resistance of the
besieged at once collapsed, the inhabitants being
terror-stricken at the sight of the flaming naphtha.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>
There is no trace of an explosive here, yet a French
Arabist would have us believe that muskets were in
use during this Caliph’s reign.</p>

<p><em>Al-bunduqani</em>, the man who carries a <em>bunduq</em>,
which in this connection is a contraction for
<em>qaus al-bunduq</em>, or simply <em>qaus bunduq</em>,<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> was an
epithet bestowed on Harun by the public, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>assumed by himself; and in translating one of
the “Arabian Nights” with this title, M. Gauttier
remarks: “Bondouk signifie en Arabe harquebuse,
albondoukani signifie l’arquebusier.”<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> This
argument may be illustrated by a more familiar
one: “Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad”
(1 Sam. xx. 40); but artillery signifies cannon;
therefore, &amp;c. &amp;c. It may be remarked that <em>arquebuse</em>
is ambiguous. “Avant d’être une arme à feu
l’arquebuse était une arme à jet,” says Dr. Dozy,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>
who is supported by M. Scheler: “l’arquebuse était
à son origine une sorte d’arbalète.”<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> Assuming,
however, as Gauttier evidently did, that <em>arquebuse</em>
meant a firearm, his argument only establishes the
use of firearms in the ninth century, if we take
<em>signifie</em> as equivalent to <em>means now, in the year
1822, and meant also in the time of Harun</em>. The
question, therefore, turns upon the meaning of the
words <em>bunduq</em>, or <em>qaus bunduq</em>, in the time of the
great Caliph, and an anecdote told by Masudi leaves
no doubt about what that meaning was.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> He tells
us that in the time of Muhtadi Billah, 868-9, a
negligent porter was sentenced by his master to be
tied up (apparently in a room or courtyard) and shot
at fifty times by a man armed with a <em>qaus bunduq</em>,
which carried leaden <em>bunduq</em>. There is not the
slightest allusion to charge, cartridge, gunpowder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>wad, or match, nor to the operation of loading.
The ammunition consisted solely of leaden balls.
Although the marksman sent his fifty <em>bunduq</em> home,
the porter was so little the worse for his punishment
that, when all was over, he made a coarse but
cutting remark to his tormentor. There can be no
question of firearms here: one, or at most two
bullets fired by so good a shot from any firearm
ever constructed would have silenced the porter
for ever. The marksman was <em>al-bunduqani</em>, the
<em>bunduq</em> were leaden balls, and the <em>qaus bunduq</em> was a
pellet-bow = stone-bow<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> = كلوله كمان (golulé keman) =
<em>golail</em>, used to this day by the Karens of Burma, and
known to everybody who has been in India. Such
is the explanation of <em>qaus bunduq</em> given by the
commentator Tabrizi in a note on one of Motanebbi’s
poems&mdash;a bow which discharges a ball as
big as a hazel nut.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> The bow itself is a long-bow
with two strings joined at their centre by a bit of
cloth or soft leather, which supports a ball generally
of baked clay or stone. If Hansard’s plate be
correct, the western stone-bow was a cross-bow with
two strings.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> The golail, as we learn from one of
the oldest of the “Arabian Nights,” was chiefly
used for shooting birds, squirrels, &amp;c.: “he shooteth
birds with a pellet of clay,”<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> ببندقة من طين. Again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>when the first Kalandar missed his bird and hit the
Wazir in the eye, he was using a <em>qaus al-bunduq</em>,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>
قوس النبدق. The insult conveyed by the words
of the Sultan Kai-kubad, when speaking of the
dead leader of the Mughals, lay in the fact that the
golail was not a soldier’s weapon, but merely a
sporting implement: “No one would condescend to
shoot an arrow at a dead body; it is only a pellet-ball
that is fit for such (carrion) as this.”<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> We
need not pursue the matter further: in the primitive
and simple golail is found the musket carried
by the Caliph Harun er-Reshid.</p>

<p>From a passage in the “Chachnama,” given in
Barnes’ “Travels into Bokhara,” it is clear that the
Moslems in their invasion of India relied upon
incendiaries to meet the attacks made upon them
with elephants, which are very much afraid of fire.
At the battle of Alor, 712, already mentioned, the
Moslems “filled their pipes” (<em>hukkaha-e atish bazi</em>
= grenades or siphons) “and returned with them to
dart fire at the elephants” (i. 67). This fact goes far
to explain a difficulty raised by the words <em>toofung</em>
(musket) and <em>tope</em> (cannon) found in some MSS.,
in place of the <em>khudung</em> (arrow) and <em>nuft</em> (naphtha)
given in other copies of Ferishta’s account of the
battle fought near Peshawur in 1008. He says:
“On a sudden the elephant upon which the prince
who commanded the Hindus rode, becoming unruly
from the effects of the <em>naphtha balls</em> and the flights
of <em>arrows</em>, turned and fled. This circumstance pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>duced
a panic among the Hindus, who, seeing themselves
deserted by their general, gave way and fled
also.”<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> The best critics reject the readings <em>musket</em>
and <em>cannon</em> in this passage. These words were
unknown to other Indian historians, and the circumstances
of the case make the use of an incendiary
exceedingly probable.</p>

<p>“I am slow in believing this premature use of
artillery,” says Gibbon; “I must desire to scrutinise
first the text and then the authority of Ferishta.”
“These readings must be due to interpolators,” adds
Professor Bury.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> “It appears likely,” says General
Briggs, the translator of Ferishta, “that Babar was
the first invader who introduced great guns into
Upper India, in 1526, so that the words <em>tope</em> and
<em>toofung</em> have been probably introduced by ignorant
transcribers of the modern copies of this work, which
are in general very faulty throughout.”<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p>Sir H. M. Elliot says: “The <cite>Tarikh-i Yamini</cite>,
the <cite>Jami’u-t Tawarikh</cite> of Rashidu-d Din, the
<cite>Tarikh-i Guzida</cite>, Abu’l Fida, the <cite>Tabakat-i Nasiri</cite>,
the <cite>Rauzatu’-s Safa</cite>, the <cite>Tarikh-i Alfi</cite> and the
<cite>Tabakat-i Akbari</cite>, though almost all of them notice
this important engagement ... and mention the
capture of thirty elephants, yet none of them speak
of either <em>naft</em> or <em>tope</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p>Finally, we must remember that there is an
abundant supply of naphtha in the neighbourhood
of Peshawur,<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> and that the practice of throwing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>incendiary missiles was universal in Asia long before
the battle in question. The Ka’aba, as we have
seen, was burnt down by incendiaries in 683, and
this tremendous event of course became instantly
known all over Islam. At the battle of Alor, 712,
the Moslems specially prepared incendiaries to
repulse the attacks of the elephants. Igneous projectiles
were employed by Harun er-Reshid in 805
at the siege of Heraclea. The last day of the siege
of Baghdad, 813, is described by the poet Ali as “a
day of fire”: “the machines played from the hostile
camps ... and fire and ruin filled Baghdad.”<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> So
well known were incendiary shell in Persia at the
close of the tenth century that Firdusi mentions
them in the episode of Nushirvan and Porphyry:
“The Romans began the fight from the gates and
discharged arrows and pots (of fire).”<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> In 1067
Shems al-Mulk Nasr, when besieging Bokhara,
ordered incendiaries to be discharged against some
archers posted in the minaret of the Grand Mosque.
The wooden roof of the minaret took fire, the sparks
fell upon the main building, and in the end the
whole mosque was burned down.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>We may rest assured, then, that the words
Ferishta wrote in his account of the battle near
Peshawur, 1008, were <em>naphtha</em> and <em>arrow</em>, not
<em>musket</em> and <em>cannon</em>.</p>

<p>Far from possessing muskets in the ninth century,
there is no evidence to show that the Arabs had firearms,
that is, arms charged with an explosive, during
the whole of the Crusade period, 1097-1291. So
strange and deadly an agent of destruction as gunpowder
could not possibly have been employed in
the field without the full knowledge of both parties;
yet no historian, Christian or Moslem, alludes to an
explosive of any kind, while all of them carefully
record the use of incendiaries. The Arab accounts
of these campaigns will be found collected together
in M. Reinaud’s <cite>Extraits des Historiens Arabes
relatifs aux guerres des Croisades</cite>, Paris, 1829; the
Christian accounts are scattered in various volumes;
but they teach us no more than we have learnt
already in the two preceding chapters about incendiaries
and Greek fire: “les projectiles incendiaires
ont pu rester à peu près les mêmes pendant toutes
ces Croisades.”<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>At the siege of Nice, first Crusade, we read of the
Saracens throwing balls of pitch, oil and fat against
the machines of the Christians.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> Fire-arrows bearing
pitch, wax, sulphur, and tow were discharged from
the walls of Jerusalem during the siege in the same
Crusade.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>During the second Crusade we find the Arabs
making use of similar incendiaries,<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> mixtures practically
identical with that of Æneas Tacticus, <i>cir.</i> 350
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, given in Table II. Shell full of burning
naphtha were used at the siege of Acre, 1189-91,
in the third Crusade;<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> and Richard of England, on
his voyage thither, sank a ship which an eye-witness
had seen laded at Beyrut with ballista, bows, arrows,
and lances, and a large supply of Greek fire secured
in bottles (<cite>ignem Græcum abundanter in phialis</cite>),<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a>
a phrase which reminds us of the 18th recipe of
the <cite>Liber Ignium</cite> of Marcus Græcus: “put the
mixture in a glass bottle” (<cite>hoc in vase vitreo
ponatur</cite>). For the sixth Crusade, we have the invaluable
<cite>Histoire du Roy Saint Loys</cite> of Joinville,
who describes the terror excited by the incendiaries
of the Moslems, believed by all to be the work of
the Powers of Darkness. “Quant le bon chevalier
Messire Gaultier mon compagnon vit ce feu, il
s’escrie et nous dist: Seigneurs, nous sommes perduz
á jamais sans nul remède. Car s’ilz bruslent nos
chaz chateilz, nous sommes ars et bruslez; et si
nous laissons nos gardes, nous sommes ahontez....
Et toutes les fois que nostre bon Roy saint Loys
oyoit qu’ils nous gettoient ainsi ce feu, il se jettoit
à terre, et tendoit ses mains la face levée au ciel, et
crioit à haulte voix à nostre Seigneur, et disoit en
pleurant à grans larmes: Beausire Dieu Jesuchrist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>garde moy et tout magent,” &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> Yet the incendiaries
which created all this panic appear to have
wounded but few and to have killed nobody!</p>

<p>Although no evidence is forthcoming to show
that explosives were used in Palestine during the
Crusade period, there is good evidence, it has been
said, to prove that gunpowder was used by the
Arabs in Spain during the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The first, I believe, to start the theory that the
Spanish Arabs possessed gunpowder at this early
period was Michael Casiri, a Maronite, who was
librarian of the Escorial and published his <cite>Bibliotheca
Arabico Hispana Escurialensis</cite> in 1760-70;
and his method of supporting his theory when
translating the MS. of Shehab ben Fadhl, which
he dates at 1249, was the simple one of translating
barud by <em>pulvis nitratus</em>, the recognised Latin
phrase for gunpowder.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> Had he translated <em>barud</em>
by <em>saltpetre</em> no difficulty could have arisen, since
an Arab alchemist, Abd Allah, states that saltpetre
was so called in the West during the second quarter
of the thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> There would be nothing
surprising, therefore, in finding saltpetre mixtures
employed in Spain at this period; but saltpetre
mixtures, such as the last three given in Table II.,
are not necessarily explosive. Not only is Casiri’s
translation of <em>barud</em> unwarrantable, but he probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>dates his MS. a century too early. M. Reinaud, a
safe guide, believes that the MS. is Al-Omari’s,
and dates 1349,<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> eighteen years after the siege of
Cividale where the Germans used cannon,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> and
three years after <em>Cressy</em> where we certainly had
guns.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<p>Casiri’s methods are well illustrated by his translation
of an Arabic passage relating to the siege of
Baza, 1325, by Ismael ben Nasr, King of Granada.
The literal translation of the passage is as follows:
“He (the King) marched through the enemy’s
country to the town of Baza, which he invested
and attacked. By means of a great machine provided
with naphtha (made up in) hot (burning)
balls, he struck the arch of an inaccessible tower.”<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>
According to Casiri the passage reads: “Shifting
his camp, he besieged with a large army the town
of Baza, where, by applying fire, he discharged
(<em>explosit</em>) with much noise a great machine, provided
with naphtha and a ball, into a fortified tower.”<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>
He introduces, it will be observed, an explosion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>(<em>explosit</em>) into a passage which neither mentions nor
suggests one. The application of fire has no place
in the original, and suggests the ignition of an explosive
charge. He changes the meaning of the
original by gratuitously inserting an <em>and</em> between
naphtha and ball, which were one and the same
thing. He leaves us to infer that the charge was
naphtha, though it was not explosive and could
not project a ball. He speaks of the explosion
being accompanied by a loud noise, of which there
is nothing in the original. The incendiary balls
are mentioned in another Arabic account of this
siege, translated by Conde in his <cite>Historia de la
Dominacion de los Arabes en Espagna</cite>, p. 593:
“The Arabs attacked the city night and day with
machines and engines which threw balls of fire
with a loud noise” (<cite>combatio la ciudad de dia y
noche con maquinas é ingenios que lanzaban globos
de fuego con grandes truenos</cite>).</p>

<p>In this passage the discharge of the incendiary
balls is said to have been accompanied by “thunderings,”
and at the siege of Niébla, 1257, we are
again told that the Moors “launched stones and
darts from machines, and missiles of thunder with
fire” (<i>lanzaban piedras y dardos con maguinas, y
tiros de trueno con fuego</i>).<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> From this innocent
metaphor, <i>trueno con fuego</i>, the Emperor Leo’s
“thunder with smoke,” has been wrenched the
meaning that the Arabs possessed a train of artillery.
“Il n’y a rien à cela que de vraisemblable,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>says the Emperor Napoleon III.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> Nothing, I venture
to think, can be more unlikely. The Arab
writer is dealing with machines which, he says in
his own way, discharged stones and darts, and also
igneous missiles which burned with much noise.
Another Arab, already quoted (p. 4), gives a freer
rein to his fancy: the projectiles “roar like thunder;
they flame like a furnace; they reduce everything
to ashes.” In plain words, they are incendiaries.
The writer makes no allusion to the effect of their
momentum or shock; he impresses on us the effect
of their essential quality&mdash;their incendiary power,
exaggerating the noise made by their combustion.
Joinville writes in a similar style of Greek fire:
“La manière du feu grégeois estoit telle ... Il
faisoit tel bruit à venir qu’il sembloit que ce fust
fouldre qui cheust du ciel ... et gettoit si grant
clarté qu’il faisoit aussi cler dedans nostre ost
comme le jour, tant y avoit grant flamme de feu.”<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>
Unless we make due allowance for the luxuriant
Oriental imagination, we may despair of ever being
able to reach the meaning of the Eastern writers.
One of them wants to explain that the ditch of a
fort was deep and wide, and he tells us it was
“broad as the ocean and fathomless.”<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> Wishing to
state that on the arrival of the army on its banks,
the Nerbudda, which happened to be in flood, subsided
quickly, another writer says: “You might say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>that it (the river) was a remnant of the universal
deluge. As the miraculous power of the saintly
Sultan accompanied the Army, all the whirlpools and
depths became of themselves immediately dry on the
arrival of the Army, and the Musulmans passed over
with ease.”<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> A similar indulgence in metaphor,
although not so unbridled, is found in European
writers. For instance, Vegetius likens the projectile
hurled by an onager to a thunderbolt;<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> and
the Princess Anna Comnena compares the fiery
particles blown by the breath through a popgun,
or spitfire, to lightning.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to examine the accounts
given by Conde of the siege of Tarifa, 1340, and by
Casiri of the siege of Algesiras, 1342, since both
sieges took place some years after that of Cividale,
1331. The reader will find the two accounts ably
analysed in Reinaud and Favé, pp. 70-74.</p>

<p>If the Arabs had possessed an explosive in the
thirteenth century, the fact must have been known
to their alchemists, and they show no such knowledge.
There is not an allusion to saltpetre in the
Leyden Arabic MS. of 1225.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> Hassan er-Rammah,
who died in 1295, knew nothing of explosives. In
speaking of saltpetre in the year 1311, Yusuf ibn
Ismaël al-Juni says: “The people of Irak use it to
make a fire which tends to rise and move. Saltpetre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>increases the ease and rapidity of ignition.”<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> This
sentence contains the sum total of Yusuf’s knowledge
of saltpetre mixtures. He was aware of the
effects of their progressive combustion, but he knew
nothing about their explosive combustion.</p>

<p>By whomsoever gunpowder was invented, it was
not by the Arabs.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />

<small><small>THE HINDUS</small></small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the third quarter of the eighteenth century, by
order of Warren Hastings, a committee of Brahmins
collected a body of Gentoo (or Hindu) laws from
a number of ancient Sanskrit books. These laws
were translated into Persian under the superintendence
of one of the Brahmins, and the Persian
version was translated into English in 1776 by
Mr. N. B. Halhed, Bengal Civil Service. In his
preface he states that gunpowder had been known
in India “far beyond all periods of investigation,” a
conclusion arrived at by a method now familiar to
the reader: “the word ‘firearms’ is literally in
Sanskrit <em>agni astra</em> ... Cannon in the Sanskrit
idiom is <em>shataghni</em>.”</p>

<p><em>Agni</em> is found in the Latin <em>ignis</em> = fire; <em>astra</em>,
Romocki explains, is connected with the Slav <em>ostr</em> =
point (of an arrow, &amp;c.); and the compound
<em>agniastra</em> is simply a fire-arrow or rocket. In the
<em>shataghni</em>, or “hundred killer,” we have some
weapon described in the exaggerated style usual in
early times and by no means confined to India.
When Sigurd struck an anvil with his sword Gram,
“he cleft it down to the stock thereof;”<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> and “if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>one smote a mountain” with al-Mahik (the annihilator)
the sword of Gharib, “‘twould overthrow it.”<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a>
There is nothing to connect the <em>shataghni</em>> with fire:
indeed it seems to have been a mace, for in the
“Raghuvansa” the demon is said to have laid his
iron-headed shataghni upon Rama, just as Kuvera
laid his club on Jamraj.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> No mention of any projectile
discharged by an explosive is to be found in
Manu’s “Code of Laws,” and to Manu belongs a
passage in the “Code of Gentoo Laws” (p. 53)
which either Halhed has mistranslated from the
Persian, or the Persian translators have mistranslated
from the Sanskrit. Professor Rāy has unearthed
the original text of Manu (vii. 90), and
gives the correct translation: “The king shall not
slay his enemies in battle with deceitful or barbed
or poisoned weapons, nor with any having a blade
made red hot by fire,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> or tipped with burning
materials.”<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> Halhed’s translation is: “The magistrate
shall not make war with any deceitful machine,
or with poisoned weapons, or with cannon and
guns, or with any other kind of firearms.” Mephistopheles
was right:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">Halhed’s mistakes might have been forgotten had
they not been revived and elaborated by Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>fessor
G. Oppert in an essay “On the Weapons,
&amp;c., of the Ancient Hindus,” London, 1880. His
argument is briefly this: firearms are clearly mentioned
in the “Laws of Manu” and two very ancient
Sanskrit poems; therefore at some very remote
period the Hindus possessed an explosive which,
for whatever reason, fell into disuse eventually.</p>

<p>“Does the passage in Manu refer to firearms or
not?” asks Dr. Oppert. “In our opinion it certainly
alludes to them” (p. 70). We need not recur to
the mistranslation of Manu already noticed.</p>

<p>The two poems on which Dr. Oppert relies for
further evidence are the <em>Nitiprakásika</em> of Vaisampayana,
and the <em>Sukraniti</em> of Sukra. According
to the former, the Hindu deities, Sita, Indra,
Krishna, &amp;c., were authors of “books on polity.”
Brahma’s contribution to literature consisted of
10,000,000 double verses (p. 36). The constitution
of an army was as follows (p. 5):&mdash;</p>

<table summary="The constitution of an army"><tr>
<td class="tdl">Foot</td><td class="tdr">2,187,000,000</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">Horse</td><td class="tdr">21,870,000</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">Elephants</td><td class="tdr">218,700</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">Chariots</td><td class="tdr">21,870</td>
</tr></table>

<p class="noindent">The “arms in use” of one species were forty-four in
number; of another species, fifty-five. Rabelais has
only succeeded in cataloguing forty-six arms in the
introduction to the third book of “Pantagruel.”
Lest the ninety-nine arms in use might fail to ensure
success, a spell (of thirty-two syllables) is given
(p. 10) which would bring certain victory to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
who repeated it 32,000 times. Both of these
veracious works, however, undoubtedly mention
cannon and muskets, and a recipe for gunpowder
is given in the <em>Sukraniti</em>.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<p>Dr. Oppert makes no critical examination of the
texts of these poems to ascertain whether they contain
the interpolations to be found in most Oriental
works. Of their age he only says that “no Chinese
work ... can, with respect to antiquity, be compared
with the <em>Sukraniti</em>” (p. 45). As the reader
will find in the following chapter, this implies a
considerable age.</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that gunpowder was known
to a people whose language contained no word for
saltpetre;<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> that cannon were used by men whose
books make no allusion to gunpowder, with the
exception just mentioned. “It is peculiar,” says
Dr. Oppert, “that powder should not have been
mentioned in Sanskrit works” (p. 63). The same
peculiarity is observable in Anglo-Saxon works, and
is probably due to the same cause. But the fatal
objection to the existence of this very early explosive
is the admitted fact that after a time it was
discarded and forgotten. Writers who lightly tell
us so are apparently unconscious of the greatness
of the demand they make upon our credulity. They
ask us, in effect, to accept the astonishing proposition,
that a nation voluntarily surrendered, without
any assignable cause, an incalculable “advantage” in
the “struggle for existence”&mdash;the eager, continuous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>and unending preparation for self-defence which is,
in Mr. Bagehot’s words, “the most showy fact” in
human history. It is infinitely more probable that
the passages in the two poems which mention gunpowder
and cannon were interpolated by the scribes
of after-ages than that the Hindus wantonly broke
the first and strongest law of human nature, the law
of self-defence. There can be no reasonable doubt
that the recipe for gunpowder in the <em>Sukraniti</em> is
an interpolation. The proportions are given in the
first place as 5:1:1, and then it is added, “if the
powder is to be used for a gun,” let them be
4:1:1, or 6:1:1.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> And why not 5:1:1 also?
This recipe was not written by a gunner: it is the
handiwork of some charlatan of the sixteenth or
seventeenth century, who imagined that, by making
a certain mystery about the proportions 5:1:1, he
should give a semblance of great antiquity to the
recipe. But he blundered badly about the proportions.
The proportions 4:1:1 were only reached by the
Swedes about the middle of the sixteenth<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> century,
and approached by the English about the middle of
the seventeenth,<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> and powder of such strength would
have blown weak, early bombards to pieces. Other
sound reasons are given by competent critics for
rejecting from first to last the allusions to firearms
contained in the two poems. A critic in <cite>Nature</cite>
points out that a work which mentions the Hunas
(Huns or Europeans) cannot be of the age appa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>rently
assigned by Dr. Oppert to the <em>Nitiprakásika</em>.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a>
“Oppert,” says Sir R. Burton, “shows
no reason why the allusions to, and descriptions of,
gunpowder and firearms should not be held modern
interpolations into these absurd compositions.”<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a>
Mr. W. F. Sinclair concludes from the strong resemblance
between the firearms described and those
which we know were imported into India during
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, either that
the MSS. date no further back than the sixteenth
century, or that the allusions to firearms were interpolated
at that period.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> “One is naturally led to
suspect,” says Professor Ray, “that the lines (of
the <em>Sukraniti</em>) relating to gunpowder ... are
interpolations.” The suspicion is further enhanced
when it is borne in mind that in the “Polity of
Kamandaki,” an ancient work of undoubted authenticity,
“there occurs no reference whatever to firearms,
nor is there any in the <em>Agnipurana</em>, in
which the subject of training in the use of arms
and armour takes up four chapters.... The more
rational conclusion would be that the <em>Sukraniti</em>
is a patchwork, in which portions of chap. iv. were
added some time after the introduction of gunpowder
in Indian warfare during the Moslem
period.”<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> “The last chapter is apparently spurious,”
says Rajendralala Mitra, “as it describes guns as
they existed a hundred years ago.”<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> Finally,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>Herr von Romocki utterly rejects Dr. Oppert’s
theory.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></p>

<p>The military history of India confirms the conclusions
of the writers who have been quoted: not
a fact is to be found there which lends any support
to the theory of early gunpowder in India.</p>

<p>The employment of gunpowder in Europe
revolutionised the art of war and affected, more or
less, almost every human institution. “The military
art,” says Gibbon, “has been changed by the invention
of gunpowder.... Mathematics, chymistry,
mechanics, architecture, have been applied to the
science of war.”<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> Gunpowder, says A. Comte, “en
emprimant à l’art de la guerre un caractère de plus
en plus scientifique, a directement tendu à intéresser
tous les pouvoirs à l’actif dévellopement continu de
la philosophie naturelle.”<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> We may reasonably
assume that the discovery of so tremendous an agent
as gunpowder would have produced in India some
few effects, at least, similar in their general features
to the effects it produced in Europe. To mention
one or two details: Sanskrit would have coined a
word for saltpetre, which it did not possess; the
use of the bow would have been curtailed; a lasting
mark would have been put on fortifications; and
some few specimens of the early firearms might
have survived. Not a trace of these or similar
changes is to be found; not a vestige of early firearms
has remained. General Cunningham thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>that the state of the ruins of certain ancient
Kashmir temples proves the use of an explosive
in their destruction,<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> but more prolonged observation
shows that their condition is chiefly the effect
of natural agencies. “The fingers of Time, and
moderate movements of the earth, have been making
openings in some of the other old Hindu buildings
in Kashmir,” such as the little temple of Payach
and the splendid temple of Martand; “and from
their appearance it may be believed that these same
agencies, together with undermining work applied
for wilful destruction, could do what has been
done.”<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> The plentiful supply of saltpetre to be
found in the valley of the Ganges has been brought
forward as a proof that the ancient Hindus must
have had gunpowder, but the fact proves nothing.
How many centuries did coal lie within reach of
man’s hand, in England and elsewhere, before it

and south when free to move horizontally is first

century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span><a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>Early Indian gunpowder is a fiction.</p>

<p>The first gunpowder and firearms used in India
were neither invented nor manufactured by the
Hindus: they were imported during the Middle
Ages from the West. The guns of Upper India
entered through Afghanistan; those of Western
India were brought by ships. Let us consider the
latter first.</p>

<p>“If any reliance is to be placed on Moulla
Daud Bidury, the author of <cite>Tohfutu-s Salutin</cite>,”
says General Briggs, “guns were used (in 1368)
by the Hindus (of Bijanagar), and in a subsequent
passage (Ferishta remarks) that the Muhammadans
used them for the first time during the next campaign.
But I am disposed to doubt the validity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
of both these statements.... Ferishta ... also
observes that Turks and Europeans skilled in
gunnery worked the artillery. That guns were in
common use before the arrival of the Portuguese
in India in 1498, seems certain from the mention
of Faria y Sousa.”<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<p>The first observation suggested by this passage
is, that Ferishta does not say the Hindus had <em>guns</em>
on this occasion; he says they had عرابه (<em>’arábah</em>),<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>
a word which originally meant a <em>cart</em>. In the early
days of field artillery the guns were carried in carts,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>
from which they were taken and laid on trestles
when required for use. Wheeled gun-carriages
only came into general use in Europe during the
reign of Louis XI. of France (1461-83).<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> Things
followed the same course in India, and the word
’arába thus came in time to have two meanings;
most arába being simply carts, some being (so to
speak) gun-carriages. Then later writers arose who
insisted that all ’arába were gun-carriages at the
early date of 1368, because <em>some</em> ’arába were gun-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>carriages
in and after 1526. Ferishta (who died
about 1611) fell into the trap, and after him fell
several modern historians.</p>

<p>Secondly, General Briggs’ conclusion about guns
in India before 1498 seems somewhat unguarded.
It is beyond dispute that firearms were used on the
west coast of India during the last quarter of the
fifteenth century, but the evidence we possess points
to the conclusion that they belonged almost exclusively
to Arab and Portuguese ships. The fact
that Captain Cook cruised on the coast of Otaheite
in 1769 in a ship equipped with firearms, does not
warrant the conclusion that the natives possessed
firearms. Ferishta was writing about events which
took place two hundred years before he was born, and
there is a particular reason for doubting the existence
of firearms in Bijanagar at this early period.</p>

<p>In 1441 ’Abd ur-Razzak, who had been sent to
India by Shah Rukh on an embassy to Calicut,
visited Bijanagar, whose ruins may still be seen on
the banks of the Tumbhadra. He has given us a
full and amusing account of what he saw, bursting
forth into poetry on the ugliness of the natives:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“I have loved a moon-faced beauty,</div>
<div class="line">But I cannot fall in love with every black woman.”<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He was present at the great review held during
the festival of Mahanawi, when “the number of
people and the huge elephants resembled the green
sea and the myriads which will appear on the Plains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>of the Resurrection.” Not an allusion is made to
firearms, although he notices the naphtha-throwers
mounted on elephants.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>Ferishta tells us that in the year 887 <span class="smcap">A.H.</span>
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1482), Mahmoud Shah Begurra of Gujarat,
hearing that Cambay was likely to be raided by
the pirates of Bulsar, collected a fleet containing
“a force of gunners, musketeers, and archers,” and
defeated them. On this passage General Briggs
remarks: “This is the first mention of artillery
and musketry in the Gujarat history. They were
probably introduced by the Arabs and Turks from
the Red Sea and Persian Gulf.”<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> The firearms
that came from the Persian Gulf must have been
few and far between. Writing in 1549, a Jesuit
says: “The Persians use no bombards or arms of
this kind.”<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p>There is no mention of the Bulsar expedition in
the “History of Gujarat,” by Ali Muhammad Khan,
translated by Mr. J. Bird.</p>

<p>The <cite>Mirat-i Sikandari</cite>, a history of Gujarat
translated by Sir E. C. Bayley, speaks of an attack
made by Mahmoud on certain pirates as early as
878 <span class="smcap">A.H.</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1473), but neither Bulsar nor firearms
are mentioned. We are told, however, that during
a previous expedition in the same year against the
island of Sankhodhar, the infidels (Hindus) “re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>sisted
bravely and kept up a sustained discharge of
arrows and muskets” (pp. 198-9).</p>

<p>Ferishta relates that during the siege of Champanir,
1484, a shell (<em>hookah</em>) fell on the Rajah’s
palace; but he does not state how it was discharged,
nor whether it was explosive or incendiary.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<p>On landing at Calicut in 1498, Vasco da Gama
and his followers were led through the streets with
tomtoms beating, and from time to time an <em>espingarda</em>,
or musket, was fired off.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> The town seems
to have possessed only one of these weapons. At
least, the soldiers of the guard who mounted over
Gama after he had been arrested were not armed
with espingardas, but with swords, daggers, and
bows,<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> and no mention is made of there being any
cannon in the town.</p>

<p>In 1502 a sea-fight took place in these waters
between a Portuguese man-of-war and a Moorish
(Arab) ship, during which the Arab bore down on
the Portuguese, “pouring in her shot, and then
made away.”<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> The original says: “Una nube de
flechas sobre nuestra gente y algunas balas;” <i>i.e.</i> a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>cloud of arrows and some balls.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> These balls were
undoubtedly cannon balls.</p>

<p>It is stated in MSS. 826-8, <cite>Bib. Nat.</cite>, Paris,
that in 917 <span class="smcap">A.H.</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1511-12) Modhaffer Shah
of Gujarat sent to Kansuh, King of Egypt, asking
him for arms and cannon to enable the Gujaratis
to defend themselves against the Europeans; “the
people of India not having hitherto possessed Artillery
of any kind.”<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> In answer to this request,
Hossain was sent to sea in command of a considerable
fleet. If Mahmoud possessed ships with
guns in 1482, how came it that in 1511 the
Gujaratis were sending round the world begging
for firearms? Had Mahmoud merely hired for the
occasion from the Arabs the ships and guns with
which he crushed the Bulsar pirates? It is impossible
to say categorically; but two facts may
be extracted from the foregoing conflicting statements&mdash;first,
that firearms were used by Arab and
Portuguese ships on the west coast of India before
the Hindus possessed them, and secondly, that
there was an espingarda in the town of Calicut
in 1498.</p>

<p>Whatever doubt there may be about the exact
date at which the natives of Western India first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>procured firearms from the foreign ships which
visited their shores, there can be none about the
first employment of artillery in Upper India.</p>

<p>As has been already stated, the machines of the
Greeks were adopted at an early period by the
Persians, from whom they were eventually borrowed
by the Arabs, Mughals, &amp;c. The Hindus in turn
adopted the machines they saw employed by their
invaders and named them, according to their custom,
after the part of the world they came from&mdash;<em>maghribíha</em>
= <em>western</em> (machines or manjaník). At
the abortive attack on Rantambhor, 1290, Sultan
Jalalu-d Din ordered Westerns to be erected.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> The
Hindus had collected materials for making incendiaries
before being besieged in the same fortress
by Sultan Alau-d Din in 1300. “Every day the
fire of those infernals fell on the light of the
Moslems, and, as there were no means of extinguishing
it, they filled bags with clay and prepared
entrenchments.... The Royal Westerns
shot large earthen balls against that infidel fort....
The stones from the ballistas and catapults
within and without the fort encountered each other
half-way and emitted lightening.”<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> During the
attack on Arangal, 1309, the Westerns “were
played on both sides and many were wounded.”<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a>
The mud walls were so strong and elastic that the
balls of the Westerns rebounded off them “like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>nuts which children play with.”<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> Eventually the
“western stone-balls” formed a breach and the fort
fell. Such is the account given by Amir Khusru
who died in 1315, of whom Sir H. M. Elliot says
(vi. 465):&mdash;“He is full of illustrations and leaves
no manner of doubt that nothing like gunpowder
was known to him.” Near the close of the century,
1398-9, the Hindus besieged by Timur in Bhatnir
“cast down in showers arrows and stones and fireworks
upon the heads of the assailants.”<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> At the
attack on Chanderi, 1527-8, “the Pagans exerted
themselves to the utmost, hurling down stones and
throwing flaming substances on the heads” of
Babar’s troops.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> In 1528-9, the Hindus succeeded
in igniting with “fireworks, turpentine, and other
combustibles” some hay which the Mughals had
collected in the fort of Lucknow. The heat became
so intolerable that the Mughals retired and the fort
was taken.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<p>It is needless to enlarge the list of quotations:
incendiaries pursued much the same course in Upper
India as in Greece and Arabia. No reliable evidence
of an explosive is to be found until the 21st April
1526, the date of the decisive battle of Panipat, in
which Ibrahim, Sultan of Delhi, was killed and his
army routed by Babar, the Mughal, who possessed
firearms great and small.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

<p>On the introduction of Artillery the word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span><em>maghribiha</em> was gradually replaced by the more
definite word <em>feringiha</em> = European. At Panipat
the Artillery of the left centre was commanded by
Mustapha Rumi, whose name is sufficient proof of
his western origin. But traces of European artisans
are to be found long before this. When the King
of Gor crossed the Attok in the twelfth century, he
had with him “skilful Franks, learned in all the
arts.”<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> The success of the attack on Chitor in
1591, by Buhadur, Sultan of Gujarat, was chiefly
due to his engineer, Labri Khan of Frengan =
Frangistan, the country of the Franks.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> Speaking
of the Mughal Artillery in 1695, Dr. Careri tells us
that it was “all, especially the heavy Artillery, under
the direction of Franks, or Christian gunners, who
had extraordinary pay.”<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></p>

<p>Haidar Mirza gives us one or two details about
Babar’s guns which deserve a passing notice.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>was a <em>zarb-zan</em>, or swivel gun, carrying a ball of 500
<em>miskals</em>, and a heavier gun throwing a “brass” ball
which weighed 5000 <em>miskals</em>, and cost 200 <em>miskals</em>
of silver. The former was drawn by four, the latter
by eight pairs of bullocks. Let us adopt the weight
of the <em>miskal</em> given in Steingass’ “Persian Dictionary,”&mdash;1-3/7
drachms = 39.045 grs. troy, which makes
the weight of Babar’s large ball 34 lbs. nearly.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> Its
price, 200 <em>miskals</em>, would then be 7809 grs. troy
of pure (silver), or (since our standard shilling is
87.27 grs. troy and its fineness 37/40) 96.7 shillings of
our present money. The price of a 10.18 lbs. ball
of the same material would consequently be 29s.,
including the cost of manufacture. The price of
the English 4” bronze ball of 10.18 lbs. given here
in Table X., is 26.468d., or about 22s. of our present
money, exclusive of the cost of manufacture. Adding
7s. to cover the cost of manufacture,<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> its price would
be about 29s. The value of the alloy in our shilling
has been neglected here, and Queen Elizabeth’s
money may not have been worth exactly seven times
our money; but making full allowance for both
these errors, the prices of the two balls approximate
as closely as can be reasonably expected.</p>

<p>Gunpowder was not invented by the Hindus:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>its discovery by them would have fallen little short
of a miracle. The extinction of Buddhism about
the ninth century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, and the consequent establishment
of a dominant priestly class, were a deathblow
to the cultivation of physical science. By the
seemingly innocent institution of <em>caste</em>, the Brahmins
succeeded in trampling science in the dust. One
caste was not permitted to touch this, another caste
could not touch that substance; and the higher the
caste, the greater the number of forbidden objects.
The study of experimental science was consequently
thrown back upon the lowest and poorest classes,
who had neither the means, the leisure, nor the
inclination to pursue it. Thus “the spirit of inquiry
gradually died out,” says a Hindu Professor of
Chemistry, “and the name of India was all but
expunged from the map of the scientific world.”<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br /><br />

<small><small>THE CHINESE</small></small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">China</span>, like India, affords an example of “arrested
civilisation:” the Chinese intellect and language
became petrified while still in a primitive stage of
development. But, unlike the Hindus, the Chinese
betook themselves at an early period to historical
pursuits. “Debarred both by the nature of the
material at their command and by a lack of original
genius from indulging in the higher branches of
imaginative writing, Chinese authors devoted themselves
with untiring energy and with very considerable
ability to the compilation of information concerning
their own and neighbouring countries.”<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a>
Among the results of their labours are the “Twenty-One
Histories,” from the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> to the
middle of the seventeenth century, sixty-six folio
volumes, and a number of vast Encyclopædias, of
which the <em>Koo-kin-too-shoo</em>, &amp;c., occupies 6109
volumes. From such immense compilations and
other sources Chinese scholars have supplied us
with much information about the present subject.</p>

<p>Although the invention of gunpowder is disclaimed
for his countrymen “by every (Chinese)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>writer who treats seriously” on the subject,<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> the
people cherish the legend that the invention was
made by a Chinaman in some forgotten past. The
existence of this legend among a people possessed
of a deep veneration for antiquity is in no way surprising.
Every Chinese custom, art, and institution
is supposed to be very ancient, and what is not
really old is readily invested with fictitious antiquity.
The world as we know it, they tell us, came into
being 2,670,000 years before Confucius, who was a
contemporary of the prophet Daniel. “The more
sober historians, however, are content to begin with
a sufficiently mythical Emperor, who reigned only
2800 years before the Christian era.”<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> This insatiable
craving for antiquity is shown in all their works.
“As with all other arts (the Chinese) have claimed
for the manufacture of porcelain an antiquity far
beyond the actual facts of the case. This exaggerated
estimate of the antiquity of Chinese porcelain
was for a long time supported by the supposed discovery
in Egypt of certain small bottles made of real
porcelain and inscribed with Chinese characters,
which were said to have been found in tombs at
Thebes, dating as early as 1800 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> The fact, however,
that they are inscribed with quotations from
Chinese poets of the eighth century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, and have
characters of a comparatively modern form, shows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>that the whole story of their discovery is a fraud....
During all periods Chinese potters were constantly
in the habit of copying earlier styles and of
forging their marks, so that very little reliance can
be placed on internal evidence. Indeed, the forgeries
often deceive the Chinese collectors of old porcelain.”<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<p>According to the Jesuits, Chinese history is free
from this defect. Father Moyria de Maillac (commonly
called Mailla), in the long introductions to
his <cite>Histoire générale de la Chine</cite>, begs us to put
our full trust in the Chinese historians, and pleads
that, however mendacious the lower orders of the
nation, the better classes love the truth, and the
historians are honest and accurate. But such pleas
in bar of investigation and verification are of little
weight unless it can be shown that Chinese historians
never drew (in good faith) erroneous conclusions,
never mistook the meaning of a document,
were never misinformed, and never made a slip in
writing. As Gibbon clearly saw,<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> the Jesuits were
blinded by admiration of the Celestials; their sharp,
critical sagacity was blunted by the air of sincerity
displayed in Chinese books.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> But this “accent de
sincérité” is ruthlessly treated by MM. Langlois
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>and Seignobos: “C’est une impression presque
irrésistible, mais elle n’en est pas moins une illusion.
Il n’y a aucun critérium extérieur ni de la sincérité
ni de l’exactitude. ‘L’accent de sincérité,’ c’est
l’apparence de la conviction; un orateur, un acteur,
un menteur d’habitude l’auront plus facilement en
mentant qu’un homme indécis en disant ce qu’il
croit. La vigeur de l’affirmation ne prouve pas
toujours la vigeur de la conviction, mais seulement
l’habileté ou l’effronterie. De même l’abondance et
la précision des détails, bien quelles fassent une
vive impression sur les lecteurs inexpérimentés, ne
garantissent pas l’exactitude des faits;<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> elles ne
renseignent que sur l’imagination de l’auteur quand
il est sincère ou sur son impudence quand il ne l’est
pas. On est porté de dire d’un récit circonstancié:
‘Des choses de ce genre ne s’inventent pas.’ Elles
ne s’inventent pas, mais elles se transportent très
facilement d’un personage, d’un pays ou d’un temps
à un autre.&mdash;Aucun caractère extérieur d’un document
ne dispense donc d’en faire la critique.”<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> In
spite of their zeal for the truth, Chinese historians
are no more infallible than others, and it is certain
that they were unconsciously led into error at times
by the change in meaning which military words
underwent in China as well as elsewhere. Thus</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>Mao-yiian-i erroneously believed that <em>huo-p’áu</em> meant
<em>cannon</em> in old times, as it did in his own. But from
a sketch he has fortunately given of one (reproduced
by Romocki, i. 41) it is clear that it originally
meant a machine for scattering blazing incendiary
matter.</p>

<p>The first two questions that present themselves
are: (1) Did the Chinese make use of gunpowder
in a very distant past? and (2) did they possess an
explosive shell in 1232?</p>

<p>The Chinese annals give no support to the hypothesis
that gunpowder was known in China in very
early times. Currency was given to the popular
legends about it by such writers as Father Gaubil,
who declares that gunpowder had been in use for
1600 years when he wrote, and Father Amiot, who
fully accepts a much earlier date. With reference
to Koung-ming, who is said to have employed earth-thunder
(<em>ty-lei</em>) about 200 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, Amiot says: (<i>a</i>) “Les
auteurs qui parlent de Koung-ming ne le font pas
l’inventeur de cette manière de nuire à l’ennemi.
Ils disent, au contraire, qu’il l’avait puisée dans les
ouvrages des anciens guerriers; ce qui est une preuve
sans réplique que les Chinois connaissaient la poudre
à tirer ... bien longtemps avant que cette connaissance
fût parvenue en Europe.... (<i>b</i>) Les anciens
Chinois employaient la poudre (<em>chen-ho-yen</em>), soit
dans les combats, soit pour mettre le feu au camp
des ennemis.... (<i>c</i>) Cette poudre (<em>ny-foung-yo</em>) a
une vertue qui, ce me semble, pourrait être d’une
très grande utileté dans nos armées; c’est que la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
fumée va également contre le vent.”<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> In (<i>a</i>) and (<i>c</i>)
of these extracts the true note of legend is audibly
sounded, and the tacit assumption that <em>ty-lei</em> was an
explosive is to be noted. As to (<i>b</i>), Amiot was unwittingly
describing some early incendiary similar
to that of Marcus Græcus, No. 2: “Ignis quæ comburit
domos inimicorum.” Such is Father Amiot’s
“preuve sans réplique” that the Chinese possessed
gunpowder in the times of the pre-adamite Sultans.
It must be put aside; and with it must be laid the
evidence of Fathers Maillac and Gaubil. First, their
critical faculty became paralysed when dealing with
Chinese history. Secondly, they evidently did not
understand the difference between an explosive and
an incendiary. Thirdly, without questioning their
good faith, they are open to the charges brought
against them by MM. Reinaud and Favé, when
speaking of M. Quatremère’s dating Artillery in
China at the thirteenth century: “(Il) ne s’est pas
aperçu que PP. Mailla et Gaubil avaient traduits
différement certains passages des Annales chinoises,
et qu’ils y avaient même ajouté tantôt des expressions
de leur cru, et tantôt des interpolations de la
version tartare-mandchou, version qui date seulement
d’un peu plus d’un siècle, et qui, par consequent,
n’a aucune autorité.”<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>

<p>Had the Chinese an explosive shell in 1232?</p>

<p>The following is a translation by M. Stanislas
Julien of a passage in the Encyclopædia entitled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span><cite>Tung-Chien-Kang-Mu</cite>, relating to the siege of
Pien-king (now Kai-fung-fu) in 1232, given by
Reinaud and Favé in the <cite>Journal Asiatique</cite>, Oct.
1849: “A cette époque on faisait usage de <em>ho-pao</em>
ou <em>pao à feu</em>, appelée <em>Tchin-tien-louï</em>, ou ‘tonnerre
qui ébranle le ciel,’ On se servait pour cela d’un
pot en fer que l’on remplissait de <em>yo</em>. A peine y
avait-on mis le feu que le pao s’élevait, et que le feu
éclatait de toute part. Son bruit ressemblait à celui
du tonnerre, et s’étendait à plus de cent <em>lis</em> (<i>i.e.</i>
thirty-three English miles); il pouvait répandre
l’incendie sur une surface de plus d’un demi-arpent
(<i>i.e.</i> about one-third of an acre).... Les Mongols
construisirent avec les peaux de bœuf un couloir qui
leur permit d’arriver jusqu’an pied des remparts. Ils
se mirent à saper les murs, et y pratiquèrent des
cavités, où l’on pouvait se loger sans avoir rien à
craindre des hommes placés en haut. Un des
assiégés proposa de suspendre à des chaînes de fer
des pao à feu, et de les descendre le long du mur.
Arrivés aux endroits qui étaient minés, les pao
éclataient et mettaient en pièces les ennemis et les
peaux de bœuf, au point même de ne pas en laisser
de vestige.” There is another account of the shell
in the <cite>Wu-pei-chi</cite>, published in 1621, but (as one
gathers from Mr. Mayers<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a>) it is so similar in the
details that the two accounts cannot be taken as
independent. They merely quote some common
document or repeat some common tradition.</p>

<p>Like the <cite>Liber Ignium</cite> of Marcus Græcus, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span><cite>Tung-Chien-Kang-Mu</cite> is not the work of one man
or of one period. The original portions (the “Old
Recipes” of Marcus) were written by Ssu-ma-kuang,
1019-86, and were named <cite>T’ung-Chien</cite>, or the
“Mirror of History,” by the reigning Emperor. The
book was brought up to date by Chu-hsi, 1130-1200,
and was afterwards continued, with commentaries,
by various writers, up to the seventeenth century.
The above-quoted passage belongs to the commentators,<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>
and was written by some one whose date,
name, and authority for his statement are alike
unknown to us; but it was presumably written long
after the event it records.</p>

<p>We have seen in Julien’s translation what the
encyclopædist actually says, but what meaning did
he intend to convey by his words? Did he mean to
say the shell exploded? The passage may be divided
into two clauses: in the first he explains generally
the action of the ho-pao, and in the second he gives
a particular example of its use. In the first clause
he says that “no sooner was a light applied to it than
the fire burst forth on all sides” (<em>le feu éclatait de
toute part</em>): in the second clause he says, “the pao
burst forth” (<em>les pao éclataient</em>). But the effect produced
by the shell shows that this latter phrase is
simply an elliptical way of saying, “the fire of the
mixture contained in the pao burst forth.” On this
point Reinaud and Favé are clear: “<i>Les pao à feu
éclataient</i> s’applique aux éclats de la flamme qui
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>sortait par les ouvertures,”<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>&mdash;holes in the shell which
were probably numerous. Mayers agrees: the pao
were lowered into the excavations, “when the fire
burst out from them, utterly destroying every fragment
of the hides,” &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> The Chinese writer was describing
an incendiary, not an explosive. Gunpowder
would have left in the hiding-place of the Mongols
a tangled mass of charred human remains and
scorched cowhide: only an incendiary could have
destroyed its contents so that “not a vestige remained.”
Father Gaubil and M. Berthelot acquiesce
in this conclusion:<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> Herr von Eomocki dissents
from it.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<p>There is nothing in the military history of China
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries to lead us
to suppose that the Chinese possessed an explosive
during that period. In 1255 Prince Hulágu had
1000 Chinese arbalisters in his pay to work his
incendiaries,<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> and it may be presumed that he would
have learnt the secret of gunpowder from them if
they had known it; but he possessed no explosive.
Father Carpini, <i>cir.</i> 1250, states that when hard-pressed
the Tartars had recourse to incendiaries,
and Rashid ed-Din, in his history of Hulagu’s
campaign of 1260, makes no allusion to explosives.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a>
The Chinese had only reached the same stage
as Marcus Græcus in 1257: in this year they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>Roman candles.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> During the siege of Siang-yang-fu,
1268-73, “Khubelai sent to his nephew
Abaka, in Persia, for engineers skilled in making
catapults, called mangonals<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> by Marco Polo. Two
such engineers were sent.”<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> We have three
different notices of this siege, Chinese, Persian, and
Venetian, and “they all concur as to the employment
of foreign engineers from the West,”<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> but none
of them mentions the use of explosives by either
side. “The Chinese at that period,” says Sir John
Davis, “were as little acquainted with firearms as
Europeans.”<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> When Chang-chi-ki’s fleet on the
Kiang River was destroyed a few years afterwards by
Atchu, it was by means of fire-arrows.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> In a word,
during the thirteenth century, the Chinese made a
free use of various incendiaries already noticed in
the chapters on the Greeks and Arabs; and they
seem to have made no progress in the manufacture
of their missiles during the course of the fourteenth.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a>
Not until we reach the fifteenth century do we meet
with gunpowder and cannon.</p>

<p>The Prince of Yen (afterwards the Emperor
Yung Loh) is said to have been “defeated by fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>arms”
at the battle of Tung Chang, 1401;<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> but
whether these arms were furnished with incendiaries
or explosives is doubtful. The first trustworthy
account of the use of artillery in China is given in
the <i>Kai-yii-tsung-kao</i>, published in 1790, by Chao I,
a man of considerable ability, and an accomplished
antiquarian. He states that in the beginning of
Yung Loh’s reign, 1407, cannon were acquired by
the Emperor and employed during his campaigns
in Cochin China.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> Whence came these cannon and
their ammunition?</p>

<p>It is antecedently improbable that the Chinese
either invented or manufactured them; for although
the Chinese exhibited considerable intellectual
power in some fields of investigation, they possessed
little genius for mechanical or chemical inventions,
and what mechanical ability they had was absorbed
in other pursuits. When actually possessed of
powder, they seem to have been incapable of making
any improvement in its manufacture. “Si la poudre
de Chine vaut mieux que la nôtre,” says Father
Incarville, the ablest of the Jesuits I have consulted,
“cela vien plutôt de la bonté des matières que du
soin que les Chinois prennent de la faire bonne;
ils la grainent très mal et ne savent pas la lisser.”<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a>
“Whatever their claims as inventors,” says another
writer, “it is certain that the Chinese have made no
progress in the art” (of making gunpowder).<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>their fireworks were no better than European fireworks.
They did not employ stars, and their largest
rockets had a length of only five inches, with an
internal diameter of eight lines.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></p>

<p>There is no trustworthy evidence, so far as I am
aware, to prove that the Chinese invented gunpowder.
The statements of the Jesuits on this particular
matter are worthless for reasons already given,<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> and
the popular Chinese tradition is deprived of any
little weight it might otherwise have had by the
disavowal of the invention by sober Chinese historians.
On the other hand, we possess a number
of facts which point to the conclusion that the
Chinese obtained their first gunpowder and firearms
from the West.</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>a</i>) It has been already pointed out that the
mangonals used at the siege of Siang-yang-fu,
1268-73, were of western origin,
and were worked by western engineers.</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>b</i>) The residence of the Polos in China, 1275-92,
was by no means an isolated fact. They
were but the pioneers of a considerable
body of mechanics, missionaries, and merchants
who continued their relations with
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>the country for at least half a century.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> It
may be doubted whether the merchants
ever lost touch with China.</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>c</i>) Yung Loh, the first Chinese Emperor who
possessed <i>ts’iang</i>, or cannon, had agents in
Malay, Delhi, Herat, and Mecca,<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> and his
agent in the latter city could hardly have
failed to hear of, and report on the use of
firearms in the West. If such were the case,
there was nothing to prevent the Emperor
from obtaining small guns by land, or guns
of any size by sea. There had been communication
by land between China and
Europe from the time of the early Roman
emperors of the West.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> It was seriously
interrupted, no doubt, by the disorders
which broke out in China at the close of
the ninth century, but it was re-established
when they came to an end in the middle
of the thirteenth.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> Mr. F. Hirth proves in
his “China and the Roman Orient” that
there was communication by sea between
China and Europe at a very early date.
Masudi speaks of the communication in
his own time, the tenth century. The
Arab and Chinese ships met, he says, at a
port called Killat, half-way between Arabia
and China, where they transhipped their
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>cargoes.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> There was constant communication
between China and the west coast of
India in the first half of the fifteenth
century. Abd ur-Razzak says the men of
Calicut were bold navigators, and adds
that they were called (in compliment)
“the sons of China.” When John Deza
destroyed the Zamorin’s fleet there, it was
commanded by a Chinaman, Cutiale.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>d</i>) The Chinese made their charcoal from young
shoots of the willow in the eighteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> and “as they seldom change
anything,”<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> they probably did so from the
beginning. Twigs of willow are recommended
for this purpose by Roger Bacon
and Hassan er-Rammah (pp. 149, 24.)</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>e</i>) The Chinese strained the mother-liquor of
their saltpetre through straw;<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> so also did
Whitehorne (A., p. 20).</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>f</i>) They employed animal glue, or charcoal, to
remove the insoluble impurities of the
mother-liquor,<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> just as Bacon did, if the
explanation of the word “Phœnix” given
in Chap. VIII. be accepted (p. 154).</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>g</i>) They incorporated the ingredients of gun<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>powder
on a <i>marble</i> slab,<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> as directed by
Marcus Græcus, recipes 4 and 13, for incendiaries,
and by Arderne for gunpowder
(p. 177).</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>h</i>) They passed their rocket composition through
a sieve of fine silk,<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> the counterpart of
Arderne’s “sotille couerchief” (Ib.).</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>i</i>) They occasionally added camphor and mercury
to their powder,<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> like Kyeser and
many other westerns (Romocki, i. 157).</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>j</i>) They called their powder <i>yo</i>, “the drug,” as
did the Germans, Danes, and Dutch (p. 6).</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>k</i>) They used varnishes,<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> of the same family as the
<i>lutum sapientiæ</i>, Marcus Græcus, recipe 1.</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>l</i>) An Encyclopædia, quoted in the <i>Pai-pien</i>,
1581, states that “on the walls of Si-ngan
there was long preserved an iron <i>chen-tien-lui</i>
= heaven-shaking thunderer, which in
shape was like two cups”<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a>&mdash;the shell of
Valturio (p. 221).</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>m</i>) Bits of metal, <i>mitraille</i>, were added to the
charge of Chinese shells,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> after the manner
prescribed in a German Firebook (Romocki,
i. 189).</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>n</i>) The shell were loaded with the <i>maximum</i>
charge that could be rammed into them,<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a>
as directed in the same Firebook (ib.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>o</i>) For repairing and closing the interstices of
their built-up bombards, the Chinese appear
to have used the same materials the Scotch
used for Mons Meg; and it is noticeable
that the Chinese preferred “western iron”
for this purpose: “Ils emploient pour les
confectionner du cuivre rouge. Dans les
interstices apparents, ceux qui emploient
du fer se servent de fer doux et malléable
pour consolider (ces machines). Le fer de
l’Occident est le meilleur qui puisse être
employé à cet usage.”<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> In the “Chronicles
and Memorials of Scotland,” vol. vi., for
July 1459, we find: “For the repair of
the great bombard at Edinburgh, brass,
copper and iron, <i>so much</i>” [<i>pro expensis
factis circa eandem emendacionem (magni
bumbardi ante castellum de Edinburgh) in
ere, cupro et ferro</i>].</p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>p</i>) In 1520 the heavy guns of the Portuguese
ships at Canton “attracted considerable
attention, and soon acquired the name of
‘Franks.’... The Chinese seem to have
subsequently availed themselves of the assistance
of the Portuguese, and of their
wonderful guns, to punish their own
pirates”;<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> a circumstance which recalls
the expedition of Mahmoud of Gujarat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>against the Bulsar pirates in 1482 (p. 116).
These “Franks,” we learn from the <i>Wu-pei-che</i>,
“were of iron, 5 or 6 <i>ch’ih</i> (6 or
7 ft.) long.... Five small barrels (chambers)
were used, which were placed (successively)
inside the body of the piece
from which they were fired off.”<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<p class="indent padl15">(<i>q</i>) The Chinese guns manufactured in 1618
were cast under the superintendence of
the Jesuits at Peking.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p>The general conclusion to be drawn from the
foregoing inquiry is virtually Gibbon’s, which may
be expressed in somewhat firmer language than he
has used, since we possess many facts which were
unknown to him. It is highly probable that the
invention of gunpowder was carried from the West
to China, by land or water, at the end of the fourteenth
or the beginning of the fifteenth century, and
“was falsely adopted as an old national discovery
before the arrival of the Portuguese and the Jesuits
in the sixteenth.”<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />

<small><small>FRIAR BACON</small></small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Roger Bacon</span> was born at Ilchester, in Somersetshire,
in 1214, and died about 1294. If the dedication
be authentic, his <i>Epistola de Secretis Operibus
Artis et Naturæ et de Nullitate Magiæ</i>, the work
with which we are chiefly concerned here, was
written before 1249.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></p>

<p>Bacon attacks Magic in this book on the ground
that science and art can exhibit far greater wonders
than the alleged wonders of the Black Art, and to
prove his point he enumerates, in the first eight
chapters, a number of wonders which (he believed)
art could produce and magic could not. Everything
is sufficiently clear until we reach the ninth, tenth,
and eleventh chapters, and they are unintelligible as
they stand. Now, it is past belief that a man of
commanding genius should have deliberately stooped
to write page after page of nonsense. The three
chapters, therefore, must have <i>some</i> meaning, hidden
from us though it be.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></p>

<p>It is unquestionable that Bacon believed he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>possessed secrets of vast importance. At the close
of Chapter VIII. he tells us by way of warning that
he may resort (in the following chapters) to certain
cryptic methods, “on account of the magnitude of
his secrets” (<i>propter secretorum magnitudinem</i>);
and, fearing that ordinary cryptic methods might
be too transparent, he wraps up his secrets in an
anagram in Chapter XI.</p>

<p>If Bacon were in possession of such secrets,
why, it may be asked, did he not publish them
openly? The reason was, as he explains repeatedly
and at length, that he firmly believed scientific
knowledge to be hurtful to the people. He protests
in his works again and again against the diffusion
of scientific information. “The crowd,” he says,
“is unable to digest scientific facts, which it scorns
and misuses to its own detriment and that of the
wise. Let not pearls, then, be thrown to swine.”<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a>
Elsewhere he says: “The mob scoff at philosophers
and despise scientific truth. If by chance they lay
hold upon some great principle, they are sure to
misinterpret and misapply it, so that what would
have been gain to every one causes loss to all.”<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a>
“It is madness,” he goes on to say, “to commit a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>secret to writing, unless it be so done as to be unintelligible
to the ignorant, and only just intelligible
to the best educated”;<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> and so much in earnest
was he upon this point that he enumerates seven
methods of baffling public curiosity. A secret may
be concealed by making use of:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent padl15">
(1) Symbols and incantations (<i>characteres et carmina</i>);</p>

<p>(2) Enigmatic and figurative words;</p>

<p>(3) Consonants only, without vowels;</p>

<p>(4) Letters from different alphabets;</p>

<p>(5) Specially devised letters;</p>

<p>(6) Prearranged geometric figures;</p>

<p>(7) Shorthand (<i>ars notatoria</i>).</p>

<p>These are among the means of veiling secrets,
he tells us, and “ill will it betide him who reveals
them.”<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></p>

<p>Bacon was not singular in holding the doctrine
of secrecy in matters of science, nor was it peculiar
to the age he lived in: it arose ages before his birth,
and was held for ages after his death. To any objections
that might have been raised against the
doctrine, philosophers would probably have replied
with Subtle and Mammon:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>A man who boldly, even fiercely, avowed such
opinions as Bacon’s, was bound in consistency to
employ some cryptic method in recording his own
secrets; and when we closely examine the course
Bacon actually followed, we find that his practice
was rigidly in accordance with his theory&mdash;in fact,
too rigidly. Those steeped in the Cabbala of
Alchemy in his own age may have grasped his
meaning, but to those who came afterwards it was
obscure, if not hidden. Even to the early copyists
of his MSS. it was unintelligible. In one of the
MSS. consulted by Professor Brewer, the scribe has
written on the margin of Chap. IX. of the <i>De
Secretis</i>:&mdash;<i>Hæc sunt œnigmata</i>; “these things are
enigmas,” and enigmas they have remained for seven
centuries.</p>

<p>The presence of two anagrams in Chap. XI. is
sufficient of itself to arouse a suspicion that some
cryptic method (of a different kind) has been employed
in Chaps. IX. and X., and this suspicion is
strengthened by their whole manner and diction.
Their style is involved, and their meaning (as they
stand) unintelligible. Bacon passes from one subject
to another in bewildering haste; from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>unfinished description of one process to instructions
about a second, which he leaves half told in order
to plunge into a third. Among directions of <i>seemingly</i>
primitive simplicity he interpolates such
phrases as “catch my meaning if you can” (<i>intellige
si potes</i>); “you will see whether I am speaking
riddles or the plain truth” (<i>videas utrum loquor
œnigmata aut secundum veritatem</i>); and he warns
us that the purport of Chap. IX. may wholly escape
us, unless we distinguish the (real from the apparent)
meaning of his statements (<i>in hoc capitulo decipieris,
nisi dictionum significata, distinguas</i>). These special
peculiarities of Chaps. IX. and X. can be only explained
by the use of some cryptic method, to which
Bacon points plainly in Chap. VIII. He there
names two cryptographers, Ethicus and Artephius,
in connection with the seven cryptic methods already
given, and he broadly hints that he may make use
of some of these methods (<i>forsan, propter secretorum
magnitudinem, aliquibus his utar modis</i>). It is
needless to pursue the matter further: Chaps. IX.
and X. are not, as they appear to be, nonsense, but
the cryptic exposition of some secret which Bacon
believed to be of great value.</p>

<p>Few of the difficulties we experience in investigating
the meaning of these three chapters were
felt by the correspondent to whom the Friar
addressed them as letters. He and Bacon had long
been in communication with each other, and as both
knew the substance which formed the <i>real</i> subject
of these letters, Bacon was at liberty to call it chalk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
or cheese or what he willed. They appear to have
had some system of numerical signs, the meaning of
which is lost to us. The tenth chapter begins with
a reference to a letter received by Bacon from his
correspondent in the year 602 <span class="smcap">A.H.</span>, and as the date
is given in words, not figures, it can hardly have
been mistaken by the scribes. Now the year
602 <span class="smcap">A.H.</span> began on 18th Aug., 1205 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, nine years
before Bacon was born. The number 602, therefore,
is either a blind, or a conventional sign or key.
The same may be said of the number 630 in the first
line of Chap. XI., and of the totally unnecessary
30 which occurs just before the anagram in the
same chapter&mdash;“(<i>sit</i>) pondus totum 30,” <i>i.e.</i> let
the total weight be 30. No one can have ever
wanted to know the total weight of the mixture in
question: every one wanted to know the proportions
of the ingredients. Our ignorance of these signs
creates difficulties for us which did not exist for the
initiated in Bacon’s time.</p>

<p>As will be shown hereafter, Bacon has occasionally
availed himself in Chaps. IX., X., and XI.
of Nos. 2 and 4 of the cryptic methods he has given
us; but these methods apply only to words and
phrases, and the wily Franciscan did not think it
necessary to allude to the more general method by
which he set forth so much of his statement as is
contained in Chaps. IX. and X. We cannot discuss
cryptograms here: suffice it to say that some of the
early methods were too tedious and some too complicated
to be employed throughout the whole length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
of Chaps. IX. and X. The method he appears to
have adopted (as the result will show) was that
known long afterwards as the “Argyle cipher,” of
which the following letter from Thackeray’s “Esmond”
is an example. The real contents of this
letter are the phrases within brackets:&mdash;</p>

<p>“[<i>The King will take</i>] medicine on Thursday.
His Majesty is better than he hath been of late,
though incommoded by indigestion from his too
great appetite. Madame Maintenon continues well.
They have performed a play of Mons. Racine at St.

refused to him, ’twas said; his lordship being sued

[<i>and travel to England</i>] about our young nobility
here. Mademoiselle Meruel has been sent to Fort

<p>“Is not this a dull letter?...”&mdash;Bk. III.
Chap. 8.</p>

<p>This letter shows very clearly that the Argyle
steganogram is one which it is almost impossible to
solve without the key, unless the matter to which
it relates is known beforehand<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a>&mdash;a difficulty to
which Bacon’s correspondent was not exposed, for he
knew well what the subject of Bacon’s communication
would be. Here, then, we should have found
ourselves left in utter darkness were it not for a ray
of light afforded by Chap. XI. There we are told
that <i>something</i>, in connection with saltpetre and
sulphur, produces an explosion,<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> and we know that
this <i>something</i> is charcoal. Since Chap. XI. is concerned
with the composition and effects of this
mixture, what more probable than that Chaps. IX.
and X. should deal with its ingredients separately&mdash;or
at least with saltpetre and charcoal, for sulphur
was so simple and common a drug that Bacon was
not likely to dwell upon it? Now, towards the end
of Chap. X. Bacon speaks without disguise of charcoal
under the name of the wood from which it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>made,<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> and mentions the two trees, hazel and willow,
which give the best. He significantly adds that
when charcoal is added to proper proportions of
certain other substances, something noteworthy
happens (<i>si vero partes virgulti coryli aut salicis
multarum justâ rerum serie apte ordinaveris,
unionem naturalem servabunt: et hoc non tradas
oblivioni, quia valet ad multa</i>). Since, then, charcoal
is one of the subjects of these two chapters, it
becomes all the more probable that saltpetre forms
another. Bacon was writing but a few years after
its discovery, and nothing could be more natural
than that the great alchemist should bestow his
attention upon the preparation of the new salt.
This hypothesis explains simply and completely the
most remarkable feature of Chaps. IX. and X.&mdash;the
series of common and well-known alchemical terms
and phrases, referring undoubtedly to the preparation
of either saltpetre or gold, which are scattered
and hidden among incoherent maunderings about
chalk and cheese, philosophic eggs and Tagus sand,
Adam’s bones and aperient medicine. But how
could the preparation of gold lead up to the recipe
for an explosive with which Chap. XI. ends? There
is no connection whatever between gold and gunpowder,
while the connection between saltpetre and
gunpowder is of the closest possible kind. Before
giving a recipe for gunpowder it was absolutely
necessary for Bacon to describe the method of refining
the lately discovered saltpetre, without which his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>recipe would have been worthless; and he took
advantage of the close similarity between the alchemical
preparation of gold and the refining of
saltpetre to conceal the real import of his tract. By
the title of the last three chapters&mdash;“On the Method
of Making the Philosopher’s Stone”&mdash;and by constantly
harping on gold, he endeavoured to distract
and deceive his ordinary readers, leading them to
believe that he was writing about gold when he was
really treating on saltpetre.</p>

<p>The unnamed substance saltpetre, then, is the
principal subject of Chaps. IX. and X., and our
course is clear. We must treat these chapters as we
should treat Col. Esmond’s letter were the brackets
omitted<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a>-we must make shift to insert them. We
must bracket together the phrases and sentences
relating to the real subject of these chapters, the
familiar alchemical expressions relating to saltpetre.
On doing so we shall find a connected and rational
method of refining the salt.</p>

<p>In the following reproduction of Chaps. IX. and
X. I have used the Esmond brackets, but I have not
thought it necessary to reprint <i>all</i> the padding which
connects them. All omissions, however, are shown
by dots. No word of the bracketed phrases has
been changed, altered, added, or suppressed, nor has
the order of the words been altered. Nothing has
been done but to indicate by brackets the misleading
interpolations.</p>

<p>The phrases within brackets, which constitute
the recipe, will be found collected together and
translated in their proper place in Chap. II.</p>

<p>It would be presumptuous to suggest that the
foregoing solution of Bacon’s Argyle steganogram is
free from error; but I may express a hope that the
errors are few and inconsiderable&mdash;a hope founded
upon the completeness of the method disclosed.
Whatever errors may be found, there can at least be
little doubt that the occult meaning of the two
chapters is the refining of saltpetre. One sentence,
two sentences, or even more, might be selected from
the description of almost any long chemical process
which would apply with equal propriety to some
other process; but it is incredible that a long,
varied, and connected process, such as the refining
of saltpetre, could be extracted by any method from
documents professedly devoted to the philosopher’s
stone, unless this process had been designedly inserted
there, piecemeal or whole, by the author
himself. For the figurative interpretation given of
two or three words and phrases, we have Bacon’s
own warrant. He threatened to employ <i>verba
œnigmatica</i> and <i>verba figurativa</i>, and he has been
taken at his word; with the result that a rational
chemical process has been extracted from what was
previously unintelligible.</p>

<p>Having said all he had to say about the ingredients,
Bacon proceeds to deal with their mixture in
Chap. XI., in which he employs a cryptic method
without disguise:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cap. XI.</span></h4>

<p class="center"><i>De eodem, tamen alio modo.</i></p>

<p>Annis Arabum 630 transactis, petitioni tuæ
respondeo in hunc modum.... Item pondus totum
30. Sed tamen salis petræ<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> <span class="smcap">LURU VOPO VIR CAN
UTRIET</span> sulphuris; et sic facies tonitruum et coriscationem,
si scias artificium. Videas tamen utrum
loquor œnigmatate aut secundum veritatem.</p>

<p>Omitting the anagram, the translation is:&mdash;“In
this 630th year of the Higira I comply with your
request as follows.... Let the total weight (of the
ingredients) be 30. However, of saltpetre ... of
sulphur; and with such a mixture you will produce
a bright flash and a thundering noise, if you know
‘the trick.’ You may find (by actual experiment)
whether I am writing riddles to you or the plain
truth.”</p>

<p>The mention of the flash and the noise indicates
at once that we have here to do with an explosive.
But saltpetre and sulphur when mixed together do
not form an explosive. We may feel sure, therefore,
that the name of the one substance necessary to convert
the incendiary mixture of saltpetre and sulphur
into an explosive, namely charcoal, is included under
some form in the anagram&mdash;either as <i>carbo</i>, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>name of the wood from which it is made. The <i>et
sic facies</i> of the second clause shows that there must
necessarily be in the first clause, and consequently
in the anagram, some verb in the imperative mood,
such as <i>mix</i> or <i>take</i>. We may expect a word for a
weight (<i>libræ</i>, <i>unciæ</i>, &amp;c.), or the word <i>partes</i>. As
regards the proportions, the earliest we are acquainted
with approximate more or less closely to 2:1:1,
Arderne’s recipe being merely a laboratory recipe.
The proportions of the ingredients, therefore, if
included in the anagram, will probably not differ
much from 2:1:1.</p>

<p>Rearranging the letters of the anagram, we get&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">RVIIPARTVNOUCORULVET</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>or since <span class="smcap">U</span> and <span class="smcap">V</span> are interchangeable,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">R</span>. <span class="smcap">VII PART</span>. <span class="smcap">V NOV</span>. <span class="smcap">CORUL</span>. <span class="smcap">V ET</span>; <i>i.e.</i><br />
r(ecipe) vii part(es), v nov(ellæ)<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> corul (i), v et.<br />
</p>

<p>The whole passage in the original therefore
reads:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent padl15">“sed tamen salis petræ recipe vii partes, v novellæ
coruli, v et sulphuris,” &amp;c.; that is&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent padl15">“but take 7 parts of saltpetre, 5 of young hazel-wood,
and 5 of sulphur,” &amp;c.;</p>

<p class="indent padl15"><i>i.e.</i> 1-2/5 sp., 1 char. and 1 sulph.
</p>

<p><i>R.</i> was the common contraction for <i>recipe</i>, and
may be seen in Marcus Græcus’ first recipe (Berthelot’s
text). <i>Nov.</i> <i>Corul.</i> could have presented
no difficulty to Bacon’s correspondent, seeing that in
the previous letter, Cap. X., Bacon had spoken of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span><i>virgulti coryli</i>. There he writes <i>coryli</i>: in his
<i>Opus Majus</i> he wrote <i>coruli</i> (ii. 219, Bridges ed.).</p>

<p>The second anagram (in Greek, Roman, and
Anglo-Saxon letters) seems to be a note to the first
and need not detain us, since we have already got
the names and proportions of the ingredients.</p>

<p>In deference to those readers who may reject
the preceding attempts to read Bacon’s riddles, we
now proceed to show, on grounds independent of
the steganogram and anagram, that Bacon was in
possession of an explosive.</p>

<p>The igneous bodies of which Bacon speaks fall
into two classes. The first class are incendiaries.
“Incendiaries,” he tells us, “may be made from
saltpetre, or petroleum, or maltha,<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> or naphtha, mixed
with other substances.... To these are allied
Greek fire and many other incendiaries<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a>.... (Burning)
maltha, if thrown upon an armed soldier, will
cause his death.... It is difficult to extinguish,
water being useless for this purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></p>

<p>But side by side with these passages we find
descriptions of igneous compositions of a totally
different kind. “There are other natural wonders.
We can produce in the air sounds loud as thunder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>and flashes bright as lightning&mdash;nay, even surpassing
the powers of nature. A small quantity of (a certain)
composition, no bigger than one’s thumb, will give
forth (on ignition) a deafening noise and a vivid
flash.”<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> We have, too, the passage, already quoted,
in the eleventh chapter, where he says that saltpetre
and sulphur and <i>something else</i> give forth (on
ignition) “a thundering noise and a vivid flash.”<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a>
Again: “Some compositions (when ignited) make an
unbearable noise.... No other sound can be compared
with it. Others produce flashes more fearful
to behold than real lightning.... We may exemplify
these effects with a child’s toy which contains
within it a quantity of saltpetre (mixture) the
size of one’s thumb. In the bursting of this bauble,
made only of parchment, there are given forth a
noise louder than the mutterings of thunder and
a flash brighter than the brightest lightning.”<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>will be evident on a moment’s consideration that the
charge of this toy must have been an explosive.
Had it been an incendiary, the paper would have
taken fire long before the pressure of the gases
generated by the combustion had increased sufficiently
to burst the case, and there would have
been no loud report.</p>

<p>The consequences of igniting these two classes
of composition are described so clearly as to preclude
all possible misunderstanding:&mdash;the incendiary
<i>burns</i> fiercely, while the other mixture gives
forth <i>a bright flash and a loud noise</i>. In the latter
case, Bacon was describing an explosion, and, as he
has elsewhere spoken of saltpetre, charcoal, and
sulphur, the reasonable conclusion is that the explosive
was gunpowder.</p>

<p>It has been said that the first of the foregoing
passages&mdash;“there are other natural wonders,” &amp;c.&mdash;describes
a rocket. As everybody knows, a rocket
in its flight makes a whizzing noise and is followed
by a trail of heated gas and sparks. The whizzing
noise can only be compared to thunder by a total
disregard of fact, for no sound resembles thunder
less. Does thunder whizz? The fiery trail can
only be called a flash by an equal disregard of fact:
it gives a continuous light. But if the rocket
carries a bursting charge which explodes in mid-air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the explosion may, with venial exaggeration, be said
to produce a flash like lightning and a noise like
thunder. Bacon was alluding to a bursting charge
consisting of an explosive, and that explosive was
gunpowder.</p>

<p>Was Bacon aware of the projective force of
gunpowder? There is nothing in his works (so
far as I am acquainted with them) which suggests
that he was. He knew that gunpowder exploded,
and he believed that an army might be either
actually blown up by it, or put to flight by the
terror inspired by its explosion;<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> but he seems to
have gone no further. He experimented, probably,
with very small quantities of it; and the behaviour
of gunpowder when fired in large quantities under
pressure is so unlike its behaviour when fired in
small quantities in the open air, that its projective
force could neither have been predicted by abstract
reasoning nor realised by even his powerful
imagination.</p>

<p>If a surmise be permissible, Bacon did not
invent, he discovered gunpowder. Experimenting
with some incendiary composition, prepared with
pure instead of impure saltpetre, the mixture exploded
unexpectedly and shattered all the chemical
apparatus near it, thereby laying the foundation of
the mediæval legend about the destruction of the
Brazen Head. This suggestion, if correct, only
adds one more item to the long list of accidental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>discoveries. The laws of the structure of crystals
were discovered by Haüy’s accidentally letting fall
a piece of calc-spar, which broke into fragments.
Malus, chancing to look through a double refracting
prism at the light of the setting sun, reflected from
the windows of the Luxembourg Palace, discovered
the polarisation of light. Galvani discovered galvanism
by mere accident. The decomposition of
water by voltaic electricity was accidentally discovered
by Nicholson in 1801.</p>

<p>However, whether as discoverer or inventor,
Roger Bacon made and fired the first gunpowder.
It fell to the lot of a persecuted English monk to
fulfil the prophecy of Prometheus, that in the latter
day there should appear “a wondrous being, who
should call forth flashes brighter than lightning and
sounds louder than thunder.”<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX<br /><br />

<small><small>ANALYTICAL TABLE OF AMMUNITION</small></small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">To</span> those who are not professional gunners, Artillery
ammunition may seem at the first glance to be a
hopeless and chaotic jumble of endless stores. This
is no doubt partly owing to the necessary multiplicity
of the stores, but far more to the absence (in
most books and lists) of any synoptic digest, or plan,
showing at one view the classification of the whole
and the pedigree of each article. To remedy this
want the following table has been drawn out, showing
the stems to which belong the various kinds of
ammunition we are concerned with here. Many
trees of a somewhat similar nature might of course
be constructed, fuller and more scientific than
Table IV.; but it has the advantage of being very
simple and sufficiently comprehensive for the present
purpose.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the table ought to have included
<i>all</i> the ammunition in use between the
introduction of cannon and the introduction of
rifled arms in the middle of the last century; but
the principle has not been pushed to its limit, nor
was it necessary to do so in order to enable the
reader to form a clear notion of the broad divisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
of ammunition. Machines lingered on for some
time after the invention of cannon: in fact they
were used at the siege of Constantinople in 1453.
Their stone balls and pots of Greek fire are not
formally included, because what is said of stone shot
for guns in Chap. XIII. applies equally to stone
balls for machines, and all that it was considered
necessary to say about Greek fire has been said in
Chap. III. Electric fuzes, and some few species of
ammunition of little interest or value, have been
also omitted, because their inclusion would have
increased the size and complexity of the table
without any counterbalancing advantage.</p>

<p>Ammunition for rifled guns has not been included,
because it is for the most part an adaptation
and development of smooth-bore ammunition.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X<br /><br />

<small><small>HAND AMMUNITION</small></small></h3>

<h4><i>Fire-Arrows and Fire-Pikes</i></h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> system of attaching incendiaries to arrows,
lances, &amp;c., survived the introduction of gunpowder
and died a lingering death. In November 1588
the Government ordered the purchase of “20 Slurr
Bows at 25s. each, and 20 doz. of firework arrows
for the said slurr bows at 5s. the doz.”<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> From a list
of naval stores for the year 1599, it would appear
that fire-arrows were discharged from long-bows as
well as slur-bows:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Hansard gives a plate of an English archer, 1250,
with <i>spicula ignita</i>, or arrow tipped with wildfire.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a>
Sir R. W. Payne-Gallwey gives a sketch of a slur-bow.
It is a cross-bow, with a barrel and a single
string which works in two slits cut in the sides of
the barrel.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p>Fire-lances were used, perhaps for the last time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>at the first siege of Bristol, 1643. There, Prince
Rupert tells us, “Captain Clerk, Ancient Hodgkinson,
and some others running in upon (the Royalists)
with fire-pikes, neither men nor horses were able to
endure it. The fire-pikes did the feat.”<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></p>

<p>Fire-arrows had a longer spell of existence, and
were used by the Chinese against the French in
1860.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<h4><i>Hand Grenades</i></h4>

<p>Incendiary hand grenades are of great antiquity.
We have seen that earthenware grenades were used
at the siege of Salonika,<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> 904. Towards the end of
the thirteenth century Hassan er-Rammah describes
grenades made of bark, papyrus, or glass&mdash;materials
well adapted to break up on impact and scatter
about their burning contents.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> They were used at
the passage of the Lys in 1382:&mdash;“Adonc vinrent
arbalêtriers et gens de pied avant; et si en y avait
aucuns qui jetait de bombardes portatives et qui
traioient grands quarriaulx empennés de fer,” &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a>
By a common figure of speech Froissart calls the
grenade a bombard, just as the author of the
“Avowing of Arthur” calls a shot a gun:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“... there came fliand a gunne</div>
<div class="line">And lemet as the leuyn....”<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></div>

<p class="center f09">(A gun came flying by and gleamed like lightning.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>The plate from the MS. of Kyeser’s <i>Bellifortis</i>,
1405, given by Herr von Romocki (i. 169), shows
three projectiles which were unquestionably hand
grenades. Figs. 25 and 30 are provided with
spikes, like crow’s-feet.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> Fig. 27 is a flask or
bottle of the same family as Hassan’s grenades,
and was probably made of earthenware. It was
by an explosive earthenware grenade that Del Vasto
was severely wounded in 1528, during the sea-fight
between the French and Spaniards off Cape Campanella.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a>
The Comte de Rendan was killed by a
grenade of unknown construction at the siege of
Rouen, 1562,<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> and grenades were freely used at the
siege of Famagusta, 1572. Du Bellay tells us that
grenades were made in large quantities at Arles in
1536.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> As it is improbable that iron grenades could
have been turned out in large quantities in the first
half of the sixteenth century, we may conclude that
they were either earthenware or some form of brittle
brass. This is rendered probable by Whitehorne’s
remarks on the subject. He says that “earthen
bottles or pottes,” filled with incendiary or explosive
matter, had been formerly used; but he recommends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>“hollow balles of metal, as bigge as smal boules and
¼ in. thick, cast in mouldes and made of 3 partes
of brasse and 1 of tinne.” Their charge consisted
of “3 partes serpentine, 3 partes fine corne pouder,
and 1 part rosen.” A little fine corned powder was
used as priming; and he directs the grenades to be
“quickly thrown,” as they will almost immediately
“breake and flye into a thousand pieces.” The
want of a proper fuze rendered their use so
dangerous that he advises trials to be made with
them, “to see how long they will tarry before they
breake.”<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></p>

<p>Major Ralph Adye mentions that grenades were
supposed to be capable of being thrown 13 fathoms,
or 26 yards.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></p>

<p>Evelyn says in his “Diary” that on 29th June
1678, he saw at the Hounslow Camp certain soldiers
“called granadiers, who were dexterous in flinging
hand-granades.” In the <cite>Archæological Journal</cite>,
xxiii., 22, will be found a plate “Blow your Match,”
after a sketch by Lens, “limner to His Majesty”
George II., which represents a grenadier of the 1st
Regiment of the Guards in 1735, grenade in hand.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI<br /><br />

<small><small>WAR ROCKETS</small></small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Incendiary</span> rockets were known in the East from
an early time, and they are frequently mentioned at
later periods; but we are told so little about the loss
they inflicted upon an enemy that one is inclined to
suspect their effect was confined to wounding a few
men and frightening elephants and horses. They
are said to have been used by the Chinese against
the Tatars in 1232.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> The <cite>Malzufat-i Timuri</cite> and
the <cite>Zafarnama</cite> leave us in doubt whether Timur’s
rockets were used or not at the great battle of Delhi,
1399.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> The effect produced by a single rocket led
to the fall of the strong fort of Bitar in 1657, but
this result was purely accidental. The commander
of the fort, foreseeing that an assault would be made
upon one of the bastions which had been much
damaged by artillery fire, ordered a hole to be dug
in it and filled with gunpowder, grenades, &amp;c., intending
to blow up the besiegers when they entered.
Just before the assault was made, one of the besiegers’
rockets fell by accident into this pit and
fired its contents, creating thereby so much loss and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>confusion among the garrison that the place was
carried after a short struggle by Aurangzeb’s troops.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></p>

<p>In the West, rockets were employed as early as
1380,<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> if not earlier; but they were never looked on
with favour, and they appear to have been seldom,
if ever, used between the earlier part of the fifteenth
century and our bombardment of Boulogne with
Congreve rockets in 1806. Dunois’ capture of Pont
Audemer in 1449 was a consequence of a fire that
broke out in the town; but the fire appears to have
been caused by a hand-grenade or fire-arrow, not by
a rocket. However, the exact meaning of the word
<em>fusus</em> is so doubtful that the matter is not worth
pursuing.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></p>

<p>Towards the close of the eighteenth century
rockets were almost forgotten in the one European
city where they were most likely to have been
remembered&mdash;Constantinople. In 1783-84 Tipu
Sultan sent a mission to the Sultan of Turkey, and
of the presents which they offered “none were so
much admired as the Rockets, of which there were
none in that country.”<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>We find traces of the employment of rockets,
both incendiary and explosive, in India in this very
year, when some “rocketeers ... threw confusion
and dispersion into the masses of the Mahrattas.”<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a>
Nothing can be more probable: the army of the
Mahrattas was an army of cavalry, and horses are
terrified by fire in any form. The Indian rocket at
this time had a tube of 8” length and 1.5” diameter,<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a>
and it does not appear to have been a very effective
missile. Speaking of our loss during the attack on
Seringapatam, 1792, Colonel Dirom says: “(We had)
a good many wounded, though in general but slightly,
chiefly by rockets.”<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> Within the next few years,
however, rockets were much improved, and an eye-witness
speaks of the use of “rockets of an uncommon
weight” at the siege of Seringapatam, 1799.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a>
These were undoubtedly explosive rockets, for Col.
Gerrard saw one of them kill three and wound four
of our men.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the taking of Seringapatam the
Ordnance Office applied to the Laboratory, Woolwich
Arsenal, for the services of some one who understood
the manufacture of war rockets. The Laboratory
referred the Ordnance to the East India Company,
who replied that they knew of no one who possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>such knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> This state of things led Colonel
Congreve to turn his attention to the subject. It
is not correct to say that he brought rockets from
India,<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> for he never was there. He knew of course&mdash;the
whole world knew&mdash;that war rockets were
employed there: “I knew that rockets were used
for military purposes in India, but that their magnitude
was inconsiderable and their range not exceeding
1000 yards.”<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> His object was to make large
incendiary and explosive rockets with a range of
1000-3500 yards, and he succeeded, perhaps, as well
as the materials at his disposal permitted. He never
laid claim to the invention of war rockets: “What
I have done,” he says, “towards the perfection of
this weapon is as much my own as if the original
invention of rockets in general were mine.”<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a></p>

<p>Oberst-Lieutenant Jähns tells us that, from a
certain point of view, the Emperor Caligula’s rockets
were on a level with those of Congreve.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> It may be
doubted, however, whether Caligula’s rockets would
have produced the same effect as the Congreve
rockets at Copenhagen in 1807,<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> or at Walcheren
in the same year, when the French Commandant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>General Monnet, protested against their use. They
did good service at the passage of the Adour in 1813,
and at the battle of Leipsig, where Captain Bogue,
who commanded the Rocket Brigade, was killed.
A French infantry brigade in the village of Paunsdorf,
“unable to withstand the well-directed fire (of
rockets), fell into confusion, began to retreat,” and
ultimately surrendered to the Rocket Brigade.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> Two
years afterwards, at Waterloo, the rockets, under
Sergeant Daniel Dunnett, proved very effective.</p>

<p>Of late years rockets have fallen into disrepute
everywhere, owing to radical defects explained by
Captain C. O. Browne, R.A.;<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> and their use is unlikely
to be revived until the chemists make some
unforeseen and astonishing discovery.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII<br /><br />

<small><small>GUNPOWDER</small></small></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> oldest recipe for gunpowder is Roger Bacon’s.
If the solution of his anagram which I have ventured
to propose be accepted, the proportions of the ingredients
in 100 parts were:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">The French recipe of 1338 being incomplete (Table
VIII.), the next complete recipe for gunpowder is that
given in the MSS. of Dr. John Arderne of Newark,
who began to practise as a surgeon before 1350:<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a>&mdash;
“Pernez <i>j.</i> <i>li.</i> de souffre vif; de charbones de

</tr></table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The word <em>gonne</em>, in the sense of cannon, must have
been commonly known during the last quarter of
the fourteenth century; for Chaucer uses it with
this meaning in the “Hous of Fame,” iii. 553, cir.
1380&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“As swift as pelet out of gonne,</div>
<div class="line">Whan fyr is in the poudré ronne;”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and Langley uses it with the same meaning in the
C text of his “Vision of Piers Plowman,” xxi. 293,
<i>cir.</i> 1393:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“Set bows of brake and brasene gonnes,</div>
<div class="line">And shoot out shot enough his sheltrums to blend.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now the explanatory phrase, “qe l’em appelle
gonne,” shows that <em>gonne</em> was but little known
when the above recipe was written. We may
therefore date it at 1350.</p>

<p>It will be observed that down to the word
<em>marbre</em>, the recipe is a literal translation of a
receipt for rocket composition given by Marcus
Græcus.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> Yet the two powders, although made of
<em>nominally</em> the same ingredients in the same proportions,
did not produce the same effects when fired;
for gunpowder will not propel a rocket, and rocket
composition will not project a cannon-ball. The
difference in their effects was probably due to the
researches of Roger Bacon, who had discovered the
importance of using pure saltpetre and of thoroughly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>incorporating the ingredients. It is improbable that
Arderne’s recipe represents the powder used in the
cannon of his time. Its proportions are so entirely
out of keeping with those of the French powder of
1338 (Table VIII.) and those of Whitehorne’s powder
of 1560 (Table VII.), that we may regard it as no
more than a laboratory receipt.</p>

<p>It needed but little experience to show how far
short of perfection serpentine powder fell.</p>

<p>While the fouling of dry, well-incorporated
powder is comparatively trifling, a damp or slow-burning
powder, such as serpentine, leaves a much
larger residue. The consequence was that, after a
few rounds, it was exceedingly difficult to reload
small arms, a considerable part of the loose, floury
charge sticking to the fouling.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> The remedy for this
evil was the use of cartridges. Whitehorne mentions
“bagges of linnen or paper” for the charges of
cannon in 1560,<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> and in 1590 Sir John Smythe
speaks not only of cartridges, but of composite cartridges
for small arms&mdash;“cartages with which (musketeers)
charge their peeces both with powder and
ball at one time.”<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></p>

<p>There are payments for talwood (faggots) “for
drying powder” in the English store accounts
1372-74,<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> and in 1459 the Scotch Government were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>endeavouring to keep their powder dry by storing
it in waxed canvas bags.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> An official recommends
the English Privy Council in 1589 to sell certain
“bad powder” at Dorchester, adding, “the longer
it is kept the worse yt wilbe.”<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> The Navy were of
course, then and always, the chief sufferers from
damp powder. Serpentine powder, Sir Henry Manwayring
tells us in 1664, was never taken to sea
(after big guns had become strong enough to stand
corned powder) “both because it is of small force,
and also for that it will, with the aire of the sea,
quickly drie and lose its force.”<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> But corned powder
was by no means proof against damp. In the action
fought off Grenada in July 1779, Bishop Watson
says “the English shot would not reach” the French.
The powder, it was found, “had concreted into large
lumps, in the middle of which the saltpetre was
visible to the naked eye.”<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> Between the years 1790
and 1811, 189,000 whole barrels of powder, “which
had formed into lumps from the damp of H.M.’s
ships of war,” and had consequently been returned
into store as useless, were rendered serviceable in
the Government powder factory.<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>Being merely a loose mechanical mixture of three
substances with different specific gravities, serpentine
powder had a tendency, when shaken in transport,
to resolve itself into three strata, the heaviest substance
(the sulphur) settling down to the bottom,
and the lightest (the charcoal) remaining at the top.
This meant, practically, that on coming into the
enemy’s presence the ingredients had to be incorporated
afresh. To save trouble, and to avoid the
danger of a second mixing, it was for a long time
customary to carry the ingredients separately,<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> or,
at least, to carry the charcoal apart from the saltpetre
and sulphur. There was another argument,
however, in favour of this course. While serpentine
powder, however tightly secured, gave out a large
quantity of impalpable dust which might cause an
explosion at any moment, no explosion was possible
so long as the ingredients were kept asunder. But
whatever was the reason for resorting to such an
expedient, it is evident that the remedy was nearly
as bad as the disease.</p>

<p>Serpentine powder had another drawback,&mdash;it
required very careful ramming home. “Thrust the
pouder home fair and softly,” says Whitehorne.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a>
“The powder rammed in too hard and the wad
also,” says Bourne in 1587, “it will be long before
the peece goeth off.... The powder too loose ... will
make the shotte to come short of the mark....
Put up the powder with the rammer head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>somewhat close, but beat it not too hard.”<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> By
beating it too hard the interstices between the particles
through which the flame permeated the charge
were diminished in size, and if beaten sufficiently
hard the mixture tended to become a solid which
burned away without exploding. Finally, the combustion
of serpentine, at the best, was so slow that
a large volume of its gas escaped wastefully through
the vent.</p>

<p>These evils were in some cases much lessened,
and in others quite got rid of by the gradual introduction
of corned powder, which is mentioned in
1429 in the Firebook of Conrad von Schongau,<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> and
was in use for hand-guns in England long before 1560.
Corned powder (1) deposited less fouling than serpentine;
(2) it was less susceptible to damp, especially
after the introduction of glazing;<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> (3) it did
not resolve into strata in transport; (4) it gave out
less dust; (5) it was much less affected by hard
ramming; (6) owing to the larger interstices between
the grains,<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> it burned so quickly that there was little
or no waste of gas through the vent, and it was
consequently so strong that 2 lbs. of corned did the
same work as 3 lbs. of serpentine powder.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> It was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>in fact, too strong for cannon for a long period:
Chemistry had outrun Metallurgy. “If serpentine
pouder should be occupied (used) in handguns,”
says Whitehorne, “it would scant be able to drive
their pellets<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> a quoit’s cast from their mouths; and
if handgunne (<i>i.e.</i> corned) pouder should be used in
pieces of ordnance, without great discretion, it would
quickly break or marre them.”<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> Here we have the
cause which necessitated the general retention of
serpentine powder for cannon until the first half (or
middle) of the sixteenth century, after which it is
heard of no more except for secondary purposes,
such as priming, &amp;c. We must not overlook the
importance of Whitehorne’s remark. He was an
educated man of sound, practical sense, who had
been a student of Gray’s Inn, and whose experience
was not confined to the English Artillery, for he
had seen service in the Low Countries. What he
says is a sufficient safeguard against inferring too
much from Schongau’s mention of corned powder in
1429. It came slowly into use for hand-grenades
and small arms in the fifteenth century; but no
country then possessed cannon strong enough to
stand its explosion, and it did not come into general
use for another century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to its being at first too strong for big
guns, corned powder had the disadvantage of being
dearer than serpentine. The latter was sold in 1569
at £80 the last (2400 lbs.); the former in 1570 at
£90.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> The following Table gives the price of English

<p><br />The remarkable uniformity in the prices of English
powder has been noticed by Prof. Rogers in
his “History of Agriculture and Prices,” iv. 631.
He thinks that “fine” powder meant priming
powder, because infantry soldiers were usually
served out with 1 lb. “common” (corned) powder
and ¼-lb. “fine” powder. It doubtless did at one
time; but the term was applied to all small-arm
powder eventually.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>The prices of the first two powders have necessarily
been calculated. The price of charcoal in
1347 was .013d. per lb.; in 1378 it was .02d.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> The
prices of sulphur and saltpetre in 1347 were 8d.
and 18d. per lb. respectively;<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> in 1378 they
were (for large quantities) 4d. and 20d. respectively.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a>
From an English MS., quoted by the
Emperor Napoleon III., it appears that the cost of
manufacturing powder at Southampton in 1474 was
.864d. per lb.;<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> and, as it is the only fact available,
I have been obliged to assume that this was the
cost of making powder in 1347 and 1378. But it
is probably not far from the truth. The proportions
taken for the 1347 powder are Arderne’s, 6-2-1;
those for 1378, 3-1-1. From these data we have:&mdash;</p>

<p>The price of French powder in 1375 was 120d.
per lb.;<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> but in order to be able to compare it with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>the price of English powder in 1378, we must know
the ratio of French to English money at that period.
The French Troyes livre then contained 5760 gs.;
the English Tower pound 5400 gs. Therefore&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f09">1 livre (pure silver) = 16/15 pound (pure silver).</p>

<p class="noindent">Under Philip of Valois (1328-50) the livre was
debased to 1/12 its original value,<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> and almost simultaneously
the pound was debased by Edward III.
to 4/5 its primitive value.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> Or 1 good livre was worth
12 bad livres, and 1 good pound was worth 5/4 of a
bad pound. Therefore&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f09">12 livres = 16/15 (5/4 pound) = 4/3 pound; or 9 livres = 1 pound.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">Dividing the price of 1 lb. French powder, 1375,
by the price of 1 lb. English powder, 1378, we get
120/13.664 = 8.7; so that the French powder at this
period was somewhat cheaper than the English. As
the purchasing power of fourteenth-century money
was about ten times that of ours, the French powder
of 1375 cost about 11s., and the English powder of
1378, 11s. 4½d. per lb.</p>

<p>The high price of early gunpowder resulted
from high freights and (in the case of saltpetre)
the rapacity of Eastern merchants. We may form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>some notion of the price they exacted for their
saltpetre which cost them little,<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> from the price
they put upon their naphtha which cost them next
to nothing. “Another fountayne there is towarde
the Oryent whereof is made fyre grekysshe, with
other myxtyons (mixtures) that is put thereto; the
which fyre when it is taken and lyght is so hote
that it can not be quenched with water, but with
aysel (vinegar), urine or sande only. The Sarasynes
sell this water dere, and derer than they do good
wyne.”<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a></p>

<p>The manufacture of gunpowder soon became a
trade. We find a powder-mill in Ausburg in 1340,
in Spandau in 1344, and in Liegnitz in 1348.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a>
There was a gunmaker in Stockholm in 1430, who
was very probably a powder-maker too;<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> and it is
certain that there was a powder-maker there in
1464&mdash;Mäster Berend.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> Nor were Governments
blind to the importance and the profit of the trade.
Beckmann states that the Archbishop of Magdeburg
in 1419 only permitted the collection of saltpetre
on payment of a license,<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> and Clarke informs us
that the Pope and the Archduke of Bavaria engaged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>themselves in powder-making at an early date.<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a>
Louis XI. appointed commissioners in 1477 to
collect all the saltpetre they could find, with power
to force an entry wherever they suspected it was
stored.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a></p>

<p>During the Ancient Period, say 1250-1450,
when serpentine was exclusively used, one powder
could only differ from another in composition, that
is, in the proportions of the ingredients used, supposing
them to be equally pure; during the Modern
Period, say 1700-1886, the powders used (in each
individual State) differed only, as a general rule,
in the size of the grain;<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> during the Transition
Period, 1450-1700, they generally differed both in
composition and grain.</p>

<p>The proportions of the ingredients were quite
arbitrary during the Ancient Period, and not only
Governments, but private manufacturers, had their
special recipes. As late as 1628 Norton says there
were “infinite recipes for making of powder, but
most states have enjoyned a certain proportion.”<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></p>

<p>The introduction of corning, far from curbing
the lawlessness of the Ancient Period, made confusion
worse confounded. <em>Then</em> there was but one
variable&mdash;the proportions of the ingredients; <em>now</em>
a second independent variable was introduced&mdash;the
size of the grain. But a reaction was at hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>which set in first in France, where corned powder
had been adopted in 1525.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> It appears to have
been noticed during the second half of the fifteenth
century that large-grained powder was the fittest
for big guns, and this fact the French utilised in
1540 by officially restricting the service powders to
three, of uniform composition but different-sized
grains.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a></p>

<p>The largest-grained powder was used for the
largest guns, and the composition was 80.7 salp.,
11.5 char., and 7.8 sulph., which closely corresponded
to Whitehorne’s (corned) hand-gun powder&mdash;78.3
salp., 13 char., and 8.7 sulph.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> It may be
questioned, however, whether the French, official
injunctions notwithstanding, confined themselves
very religiously to powders of uniform composition.
Boillot, whose work was published at Chaumont in
1598, says the grain for big guns was as large as a
pea, that for medium guns the size of hempseed,
and that for serpents, &amp;c., still smaller. But from a
remark he makes on reaching the manufacture of
powder&mdash;“vous viendrez à la composition (de la
pouldre), mais par poix et mesure, selon que vous
voudrez faire les pouldres”<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a>&mdash;it is clear that
powders for all purposes were not of the same composition.</p>

<p>During the first half of the seventeenth century
the French official powder was weaker than the
above&mdash;75.6 salp., 13.6 char., and 10.8 sulph.&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>for big guns had grains as large as hazel-nuts.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> At
Pont-à-Mousson, just across the German border,
powders of different compositions were in use in
1620;<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> and east of the Rhine powder for different
guns probably varied in grain, and certainly varied
in composition. “Of the various powders now
made,” says Furtenbach in 1627, “the following
are generally employed:<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>The information given to us about granulation
by the early English gunners is neither clear nor
full.</p>

<p>When Whitehorne tells us that the method of
corning “all sorts of powder” was the same, namely,
by means of a sieve and a few heavy metal balls,<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a>
what meaning did he intend to convey by the
phrase “all sorts of powder”? There can be little
doubt that he meant “powders of whatever composition,
and whatever the size of the grain to be
produced;” first, because it would be preposterous
to assume that all the sieves of his time had meshes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>of equal size; and secondly, because there is abundant
evidence to show that, long after Whitehorne’s
time, the powders for different guns in England
(and elsewhere) varied both in composition and
grain. In 1620 Thybovril and Hanzelet tell us that
powder to be granulated is to be passed through a
sieve with holes “de la grosseur que vous desirez
votre poudre”;<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> and eight years afterwards Norton
uses the very same ambiguous phrase, “a syve ... made
full of holes of the bignesse you desire your
cornes.”<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> Did they mean that the size of the grain
in their time was purely arbitrary and might be of
any magnitude whatever? A passage in Boillot’s
(earlier) work explains their meaning much better
than they have done it themselves. He first tells us
that the sieve is to have holes “de telle grosseur
que vous voudrez,” and he then goes on to explain
the proper size of grain for use in the different
classes of ordnance, as given here on a previous
page. In a word, three or four kinds of sieves
(differing in the size of their meshes) were procurable&mdash;some
for graining powder for big guns, others
for graining powder for medium guns, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;and
having fixed upon the gun from which your powder
(when grained) was to be fired (and consequently
upon the size of the grain), you were to select those
sieves which had meshes “of the bignesse you
desired your cornes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>From the phrase used above by Norton, it is
certain that several powders, differing in grain,
were in use when he wrote; from the evidence of
Norton,<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> Nye,<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> and others, it is equally certain that
several different receipts for making powder were
in use during their time. The conclusion is that
during the first half of the seventeenth century
powders made in England for different guns varied
both in composition and size of grain.</p>

<p>The lawlessness in composition and grain during
the greater part of the Transition Period was the
natural consequence of the absence of any instrument
to measure the comparative strength of different
powders, and enable gunners to establish some
standard for the proportions of the ingredients and
the size of the grain.</p>

<p>The earliest instrument proposed for testing the
strength of powder was, I believe, Bourne’s “engine
or little boxe,” which, he says, was “very necessarie
to be used.”<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> Whether he invented it himself or
not, it is impossible to say: he tells us, “some of
(the inventions) I have gathered by one meane and
some by another, but the most part of them hath
been mine own.”<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> The engine was a wretched one.
The powder to be tested was ignited in a small metal
cylinder with a heavy lid (working on a hinge)
which when raised could not shut of itself. The
angle through which the lid was raised by the explosion
indicated the strength of the powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>A better instrument was that described by
Furtenbach in 1627.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> It differed from Bourne’s
“little boxe” in that the lid was only laid upon the
cylinder. When the powder exploded the lid was
blown upwards along two vertical wires which
passed through it; but it could not descend again
of itself, being held in the place it reached by iron
teeth (like those which supported the lid of Bourne’s
box). Nye describes this instrument, and suggests
that the comparative strength of powders should be
further tested by measuring the penetration of pistol
balls into clay, and the ranges of projectiles fired
from a small mortar.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> This is, I believe, the first
proposal of the <em>mortar éprouvette</em>, 1647. The
French certainly adopted them before 1686, often
though it has been said that they then introduced
them. On the 18th September of this year Louis
XIV. published an ordonnance complaining of “the
variety of eprouvettes” in use for testing powder,
and directing that for the future no powder should
be accepted unless 3 oz. of it could throw a ball
of 60 lbs. 50 toises (320 ft.) from the Government
pattern mortar.<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> In a previous ordonnance
(April 16, 1686) the King had protested against the
bad charcoal (<em>de méchante qualité</em>) constantly employed;
against impure saltpetre (<em>rempli de graisse
et de sel</em>), insisting upon the exclusive use of saltpetre
“de trois cuites”; and against insufficient
incorporation (<em>dix ou douze heures ... au lieu de
... vingt quatre heures</em>).<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> But he marred the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>reforms he made by taking the unaccountable step
of introducing one powder, of the same composition
and size of grain, for all arms.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> For this blunder
the French afterwards paid in blood, especially
during the Peninsular war.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a></p>

<p>About the beginning of the eighteenth century
most countries had reduced their powders to two or
three, which were of the same composition, and
differed only in grain. In 1742 Benjamin Robins,
by his “New Principles of Gunnery,” placed
gunnery upon a strictly scientific basis, and by his
epoch-making invention of the ballistic pendulums<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a>
enabled gunners for the first time to measure the
muzzle-velocity of projectiles with considerable
accuracy. It may have been owing to the lessons
taught by this instrument that, between 1742 and
1781, we changed the proportions of the ingredients
of our powder from 75&mdash;12½&mdash;12½ to 75&mdash;15&mdash;10.
Profiting by the rapid progress of electricity during
the first half of the nineteenth century, Sir Charles
Wheatstone proposed in 1840 his electro-magnetic
chronoscope,<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> which registered to the 1/730 part of a
second, to replace Robins’ ponderous pendulum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>Wheatstone’s instrument was not adopted by our
Government, but his idea was followed up and
improved upon by Captain Navez, of the Belgian
Artillery, who in 1847 brought forward his electro-ballistic
pendulum.<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> Only one instrument was now
wanting to enable the mechanical effect of the
explosion to be directly and completely observed&mdash;an
instrument to measure the pressure upon the
bore of the gun; and this want was supplied in
1861 when Captain T. J. Rodman, Ordnance Department,
United States Army, produced his Indenting
Apparatus and his Internal Pressure Gauge.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a>

<p>This Table shows that as the size of the grain
slowly increases, the muzzle velocity decreases very
slowly, and the pressure on the bore decreases
very quickly. The consequence of this discovery
was the manufacture of various very large grained
powders such as pebble powder, &amp;c., for heavy guns.
But the thorough knowledge of the mechanical effect
of the explosion of gunpowder gained by the use of
the Navez and Rodman instruments, was of little
avail to anybody, for gunpowder had nearly run its
course. Just twenty-five years after the introduction
of the pressure gauge M. Vieille put the French
Government in possession of a nitrocellulose explosive,<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a>
and gunpowder was added to the list of things
that were.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole gunpowder period enthusiasts
seem never to have been wanting who
believed in the possibility of making smokeless
powder and noiseless powder. Castner’s powder,
which contained only 3 per cent, sulphur, seems to
have been the nearest approach to the former, but
no powder containing sulphur could be absolutely
smokeless. Whether early gunners suspected this
or not I do not know; certain it is, however, that
sulphurless powder was under discussion centuries
ago. Rabelais (who may have heard soldiers talking
about the matter) alludes jokingly to “pouldre de
canon curieusement composée, degressée de son
soulfre.”<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> In 1756 the French actually experimented
with sulphurless mixtures, one of which (80 per cent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>sulph. and 20 per cent. ch.) gave good results in
range, with very little smoke. It proved to be
worthless for military purposes from the difficulty
of corning it, and from its crumbling to dust during
ordinary transport.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> The belief in a noiseless powder
was scoffed at by Whitehorne: “There be many who
bring up lies, saying that they can tell how to make
pouder that shooting in gunnes shall make no noise,
the which is impossible.” A century afterwards Sir
Thomas Browne believed means might be adopted,
if not to stifle the sound altogether, at least “to
abate the vigour thereof, or silence its bombulation.”<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br /><br />

<small><small>SHOCK PROJECTILES</small></small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> nature of the first Artillery projectiles was determined
by the nature of the small-arm missiles in
use when cannon were introduced by the Germans.
To use the bulky and ponderous projectiles of the
machines in these small and feeble pieces was out
of the question; nothing remained, therefore, but to
adopt the darts, bolts, or quarrels which produced
such deadly effect when shot from cross-bows:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<h4><i>Darts.</i></h4>

<p>The iron darts feathered with brass&mdash;"garros
ferrés et empanés en deux cassez"&mdash;which are mentioned
in the earliest document relating to Artillery
that has been found in France,<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> dated 1338, belonged
unmistakably to the same family as those used for
cross-bows. The brazen feathers were nailed to the
shaft, and the missile, which weighed about 7 oz.,<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>was wrapped in a leather covering, so as to fit the
bore tightly. Experience quickly proved these darts
to be quite unsuited for firearms; yet they dragged
on a lingering and precarious existence for quite
250 years. In the anonymous <cite>Livre de Canonnerie
et Artifice de feu</cite>, Paris, 1561, the title of the seventy-fourth
chapter is: “Pour tirer lances ferrées d’une
bombarde, canon ou autre baston à feu de cannonerie.”<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a>
To a return of the powder on board
his squadron, dated March 30, 1588, addressed to
Government, Sir Francis Drake added a P.S.:
“Forgett not the 500 musketts, and at least 1000
arrows”;<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> and on the 8th April following the Privy
Council ordered him to be supplied with “muskittes,
200; arrowes for the said muskittes with tamkines
for eche, 1000.”<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a></p>

<h4><i>Round Shot.</i></h4>

<p>On the failure of the darts, informal trials were
begun everywhere with balls of stone, iron, bronze,
and lead, to discover which material was best suited
for ordnance.</p>

<p>Stone shot, which had been used in machines
for countless centuries, were on trial for cannon in
France in 1346;<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> and, unless a ballad written about
this time refers to machines and not to guns, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>employed them at the siege of Calais the same
year:&mdash;</p>

<p>Stone shot were in use in Italy in 1364,<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> and in
1378 Richard II. ordered 600 stones to be bought

employed more or less in England and elsewhere
until the Great Rebellion, and possibly even later.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of iron shot, perhaps, is
that in the Arderne MSS., say 1350;<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> although we

to have been sparingly employed until the time of

troops in wooden buildings, &amp;c., they both recommend
that the balls should be heated red-hot Hot

by Stephen Bathory, King of Poland.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> It was a
simple matter to discharge hot projectiles from a
machine, but a delicate operation to load a gun
with them without exploding the charge. In fact,
it was impracticable until the thick wet wad had

Fortunæ</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> which must have been written in or before
1344, that bronze shot&mdash;<em>glandes æneas</em>&mdash;were then
in use among the Italians; and Valturio mentions
bronze shells&mdash;<em>pilæ æneæ</em>&mdash;in his work, which, although
not published until 1472, was already written
in 1463.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a></p>

<p>A document, dated 29th April 1345, proves that
the French were employing lead shot at this time;<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a>
and the accounts of Robert de Mildenhale, Keeper
of Edward III.’s Wardrobe, show that we sent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>Calais on the 1st and 2nd September 1346, 73 large
leaden shot, 31 small shot, and 6 pieces of lead.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a>
Finally, the accounts of John de Sleaford, Clerk of

<p>These trials naturally resulted in the general,
but by no means exclusive, adoption of stone as the
best material for round shot; because it was found
that not only the use of metal balls was considerably
more costly than that of stone, but that the heavier
charges of powder necessitated by metal shot exerted
a destructive effect upon the feeble cannon.</p>

<p><br />It will be noticed that the price of bronze, which
had been brought to perfection by the ancients, and
whose manufacture was independent of modern
appliances, only fell to half its old price in five
centuries; that the price of lead, which had some
dependence on these appliances, fell to a little over
one-third; while the price of iron, whose progress
depended essentially upon the use of coal, scientific
furnaces, &amp;c., fell to between one-fifth to one-ninth.</p>

<p>These figures do not profess to give the absolute
price of one round, but they represent pretty accurately
the relative cost of a round with the
different projectiles.</p>

<p>The pressures per square inch exerted upon the
bore of a gun are directly proportional to the weight
of the charges used, and these charges were directly
proportional to the weights of the projectiles used.
We have therefore the following comparative pressures:&mdash;</p>

<p>Table X. shows that the cost per round with
stone was much less than with metal shot, while
Table XI. shows how great was the disparity
between the pressures on the bore in the two cases,
which, as the calibre (and therefore the absolute
pressure) increased, became a serious matter. With
the very small, early guns, the greater cost and
heavier strain may not have been sensibly felt. The
extra cost in their case was not very considerable,
and the increased pressure may not have been even
suspected until guns began to burst.<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> But that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>these disadvantages made themselves unmistakably
felt when the guns grew larger is proved beyond
a doubt by the fact that “great stone shot and great
cannon were introduced together.”<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> Leaden bullets
were retained for hand-guns, because it was comparatively
easy to strengthen them, and the metal,
although dearer per bullet than iron, was much
easier to manipulate. Iron shot were doubtless used
as a general rule for breaching purposes, for which
stone shot were ill adapted, owing to their lightness
and liability to break up. We even hear from time
to time of the use of bronze and lead cannon balls.</p>

<h4><i>Case.</i></h4>

<p>There were two ways, in early times, of firing a
volley of small shot at troops. The first consisted
in mounting a number of small bombards on one
carriage and firing them all, or a certain number of
them, together. Gattaro speaks of 144 bombards
mounted on the same bed, and so arranged as to fire
thirty-six at a time.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> The whole apparatus was
called a <em>ribaudequin</em>, <em>barricade</em>, <em>orgue</em>, <em>orgelgeschütz</em>,
&amp;c.; the two latter names being given to it because
it resembled “organ-pipes placed upon a broad carriage.”<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a>
By the second method the bullets required
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>for the volley were put for convenience in a cartridge
case or canister, and fired from a large bombard.
The bullets, according to General Köhler, were
simply pebbles of flint.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a> During the Indian Mutiny,
I forget where, a volley of “Pyramid” or “Pool”
balls was fired by the mutineers from a clubhouse
upon our storming party with deadly effect.</p>

<p>Essenwein gives plates of an orgue, dated 1390-1400,
and of a gun firing case dated 1410.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> Case

as the Great Rebellion. At the battle of Copredy
Bridge, 1644, the Cavaliers took “two baricadoes of
wood, which were drawn upon wheels, and in each
seven small brass and leather cannon, charged with

<h4><i>Shrapnel.</i></h4>

<p>Isolated attempts to fire shell from guns (as distinguished
from howitzers and mortars) had been
made from time to time in the course of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, but they proved,
one and all of them, abortive. The first methodical
and successful shell-fire from guns was carried on
during the siege of Gibraltar, 1779-83, at the suggestion
of an English Infantry officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>The distance from our nearest batteries to the
Spanish lines when the siege began was 1700 to
2000 yards,<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> and at this range our fire was ineffective.
Many of the mortar shell burst at the muzzle from
the heavy charges required for these long ranges, a
gunner losing his life on one occasion from this
cause.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> The shell that withstood the shock flew
wildly; the fuzes were “in general faulty”;<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> many
good shell were smothered in the sand of which the
Spanish works were constructed; those that burst
produced but little effect;<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> and round shot were of
no avail against sandbanks twenty-two feet high.
As fire against the Spanish works was useless, it
only remained to direct it on the working parties.
Against them our mortar fire was as ineffective as
against the works, and what was to be looked for
from guns provided only with round shot and case?
Case would not carry one-sixth of the range, and
round shot against handfuls of men, scattered here
and there, were as worthless as shell. The difficulty
was still unsolved when Captain Mercier, 39th
Regiment, suggested firing the 5.5-inch shell of the
royal mortars, with <em>short</em> fuzes, from the 24-pounder
guns which had the same calibre as the mortars,
5.8-inch. A trial was made on the 25th September
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>1779 with (I believe) the “Rock gun,” which was a
24-pounder; the “calculated fuzes,”<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> it was found,
“often burst (the shell) over the heads of the working
parties,”<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a> and Merciers brilliant proposal was
officially adopted.</p>

<p>When the siege was over, and men had time to
think, it became clear enough that excellent as was
Captain Mercier’s plan as a makeshift during the
stress and strain of a siege, it had its weak points.
The strong charge necessary to burst the common
shell tended to scatter the fragments here and
there in all directions, and the fragments were
few in number. Experiments were carried on in
Prussia in 1761 to determine the bursting charges
which broke (mortar and howitzer) shell into the
greatest number of pieces. It was found that royal
mortar shell (<em>maximum</em> bursting charge, 1 lb. 2 oz.)
broke into eight pieces, with a bursting charge of
1 lb., and into nineteen pieces with a bursting charge
of 14 oz., these figures being the means of six trials.<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a></p>

<p>In any case, the siege of Gibraltar proved beyond
denial that we possessed no recognised and effective
projectile against troops in open order beyond the
range of case. To fill the void thus disclosed in our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>ammunition, Lieutenant Henry Shrapnel, R.A., conceived
the idea in 1784<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> of a gun-projectile, which he
called “spherical case.” As he was quartered in
Newfoundland during the siege, it is improbable
that he was aware at this time of Capt. Mercier’s
plan. At all events he did not follow it, the principle
of his invention being radically different from that
of common shell. The bursting charge of the latter
was a <em>maximum</em>, the bursting charge of the former
was a <em>minimum</em>; the fuze of the latter was bored
long, the fuze of the former was bored short; the
fragments of common shell were projected by the
bursting charge of the shell, the fragments of the
shrapnel by the charge of the gun from which it
was fired.</p>

<p>This absolutely new and original invention at
first met the fate of many other new inventions&mdash;it
was long disregarded.<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> Not until 1803, when England
was in grave danger, did the authorities bestir
themselves about it: a trial of Shrapnel’s shell was
then ordered, and the Ordnance Committee reported
in their favour.<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> How great an invention these shell
were may be measured by their inextinguishable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>vitality: they outlived official apathy; they overcame
endless objections; they survived countless
modifications; they adapted themselves to rifled
guns; and at the present moment they are the best
projectiles available against troops in open order
beyond the range of case.</p>

<p>The originality of the Shrapnel shell did not,
of course, remain unchallenged. Certain officers
in France, Germany, and Belgium discovered that
the invention was an old one, and that Master
Gunner Samuel Zimmermann had employed Shrapnel
no later than 1573. His MS., it may be observed,
had been removed from Heidelberg to Rome
during the Thirty Years’ War; was sent back to
Heidelberg in 1816; and was not discovered by
Hauptmann Toll until 1852, just ten years after
Shrapnel’s death.<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a></p>

<p>Zimmermann’s projectile was not constructed on
Shrapnel’s principles.</p>

<p>It consisted of a leaden cylinder, with a time
fuze fixed in the end placed next to the charge of
the gun. The back half of the cylinder was filled
with strong (<em>röschem</em>) powder; the front half with
bullets; and the missile was intended to act a few
hundred paces (<em>etlich hundert schrytt</em>) beyond the
ordinary range of case, say, at 500-600 yards.
A very small bursting charge would have sufficed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>to burst open a leaden case: why, then, did the
Master Gunner use the <em>maximum</em> charge which was
possible without unduly diminishing the number of
bullets&mdash;a charge, too, of specially strong powder?
Because he intended the bursting charge not only
to open the case, but to accelerate the velocity
of the bullets&mdash;he could have had no other conceivable
reason.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the merits of this
missile, it was certainly not a Shrapnel, as will be
seen clearly by placing the details of construction
of the two projectiles side by side.</p>

<p>The annals of Artillery will be ransacked in vain
for Shrapnel shell before the nineteenth century,
because the successful application of Shrapnel’s
principle was impossible until an extremely accurate
time fuze had been constructed, and no nation
possessed a really good fuze before that epoch<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a>&mdash;nor
in truth until long afterwards. The results of
the Shrapnel practice in 1819,<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> after Shrapnel and
many others had devoted their best energies to the
improvement of time fuzes for sixteen years, show
how defective they still were. But although the
want of a sufficiently accurate fuze made the
Shrapnel system a practical impossibility before the
nineteenth century, a man above his fellows might
have dreamt dreams of distant case fire ages before.</p>

<p>That Zimmermann was groping about blindly in
search of the projectile Shrapnel found in 1784, is
proved beyond a doubt by the question which the
Feuerwerker puts to the Büchsenmeister: “Cannot
a case shot be made which will leave the bore whole
and burst at a few hundred paces’ distance?”<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>Zimmermann failed in his search: what he sought
did not lie on the road that he took. Like Fronsperger,<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a>
he placed his fuze next the charge, in
consequence of which (as the old man frankly confesses)
most of his cylinders burst in the bore:
“Gemainlich im Stückh angegangen und zersprungen.”
Boillot, a quarter of a century later, had a
better knowledge of gunnery: “adviserez que le
trou d’icelle (the fuze-hole) soit du costé de la bouche
dudit mortier.”<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> Zimmermann filled the front half
of his cylinder with bullets and the rear half with
strong powder, obviously assuming the stability of
the missile in its flight. Now Prof. Greenhill has
given us a table showing the <em>minimum</em> twist at
the muzzle requisite to give stability of rotation to
elongated projectiles. If a common shell’s length
be 3 calibres, it requires a twist of 1 turn in 38.45
calibres; if its length be 4 calibres it requires a twist
of 1 turn in 27.6 calibres; and so on.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> How far,
then, would Zimmermann’s ill-balanced, smooth-bore
cylinder have travelled before it toppled over, with
the certain result that, when it did, the large bursting
charge would blow the bullets any way but the
right way?</p>

<p>Zimmermann’s projectile failed, and his sole
merit consists in vaguely foreshadowing the Shrapnel,
just as Roger Bacon dimly foresaw balloons and
ships driven by machinery&mdash;“Marine engines can
be constructed and worked by one man which will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>propel the largest vessels quicker than a ship’s
crew of oarsmen.... Flying machines can also be
made.”<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> His cylinder no more establishes Zimmermann’s
claim to be the inventor, or even the
suggester, of Shrapnel shell, than Bourne’s method
of shooting “three times in a peece at one lading
of her”<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> entitles him to be regarded as the inventor
of quick-firing guns.</p>

<p>We should have been spared much unprofitable
controversy had foreign critics thought fit to make
themselves acquainted with the nature and properties
of Shrapnel’s Spherical Case before discussing its
history. Its history is simple. It was made in
England, the invention of an English Artillery
officer who owed nothing to earlier gunners in
Germany or anywhere else.</p>

the amphitheatre.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> As before mentioned, hot shot
(for cannon) were invented by the Polish king,
Stephen Bathory, in 1579.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> Their greatest triumph
was the destruction of d’Arçon’s floating batteries
and a great part of the Spanish fleet at Gibraltar,

<h4><i>Incendiary Fireballs.</i></h4>

<p>The gunners of old encountered great difficulties
in their endeavours to introduce igneous projectiles.
Their use in the early guns was not absolutely impossible,
but it would have been fruitless; for to
prove effective an igneous projectile, whether incendiary
or explosive, must contain a considerable mass
of combustible matter, and this condition could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>be fulfilled with guns of very small calibre. When
the calibre had greatly increased, during the last
quarter of the fourteenth century, any attempt to
employ such igneous projectiles as were in use with
the machines must have ended in failure. The
action of the machines was similar to that of a sling,
and the shells (or envelopes) of their incendiary
missiles were made just strong enough to resist the
pressure to which they were subjected on discharge,
although not strong enough to bear the shock of
impact with the object they struck. This broke
them up and scattered their blazing contents about.
Such projectiles were evidently unfit for use in
cannon; for the explosion of the charge would
inevitably break them up in the bore, and their
viscous contents would travel but a very short way.
Owing to these difficulties the machines held their
ground to the middle of the fifteenth century, if not
longer, and the igneous projectiles ultimately constructed
for cannon were developments of the hand-grenade.</p>

<p>In Fig. 31 of the plate from the MS. of Kyeser’s
“Bellifortis,” 1405, given by Herr von Romocki
(i. 169), we are shown a projectile which unquestionably
belongs to the same family as the <em>tonneau</em>
which terrified Joinville and his companions;<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> but
this barrel could have only been discharged from a
machine. Whether Figs. 26 and 28 of the same
plate were thrown by hand or machine depended on
their size, which we do not know. From their con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>struction,
with a mere covering of cloth or cordage,
we may safely conclude that they were not gun-projectiles.</p>

<p>We are given a detailed account of fireballs in
the German Firebook, 1400-50, belonging to the
Royal Library, Berlin, MS. Germ. qu. 1018. Missiles
are there described which consisted of an interior
ball of gunpowder kneaded with spirits of wine,
smeared over with thick incendiary matter, rolled
tightly in a cover of cotton steeped in the same
mixture, and secured by two metal bands at right
angles to each other. They could be either thrown
by hand or fired from a bombard. In the latter case
a hole was bored through the ball and the plug
which was used in bombards to close the end of the
powder-chamber next the projectile, in order to
admit the flame into the interior of the ball. The
success of the missile, it was thought, depended on
the hole through the ball being exactly opposite the
hole through the plug, a condition which could be
only fulfilled in a breechloading bombard. The
inventor believed that the ball would explode, for
he warns the gunner to throw it before the flame
reaches the composition, lest it “blow his head off.”<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a>
It is obvious, however, that the gunner’s head was
quite safe, although he might burn his fingers, when
using these incendiary toys which are unknown to
military history. The incendiary projectiles actually
used in the fifteenth century were comparatively
simple and of a different nature. Take, for instance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>the incendiary cannon-projectile used at the siege
of Weissenburg in 1469, just six years after Valturio
had presented his book to the Sultan Mahomed II.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a>
It consisted of a stone ball, considerably smaller than
the bore of the gun, which was smeared over with
thick incendiary matter and wrapped in a cloth
soaked in the same mixture. This process was continued
until the ball was the proper size for the
bore.<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> Other incendiary missiles were tried,<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> but
none of them, so far as I am aware, had anything in
common with the unpractical projectile proposed in
the Berlin Firebook.</p>

<h4><i>Incendiary Shell.</i></h4>

<p>A further step is taken in a later edition of the
Firebook just quoted, but of the same period,<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a>
1400-50. A quill full of incendiary matter is
directed to be inserted in the hole through the ball
above described, and the whole was enclosed in
an envelope or shell of earthenware or iron. An
earthenware ball could of course only be thrown
by hand: an iron ball would be fired in general from
a bombard. The metal shell was formed of two
hemispheres of iron fastened together by bands,
with a small hole to admit the flame to the quill.
A similar envelope, of bronze, is suggested by</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>Valturio in his <cite>De Re Militari</cite>, 1463, p. 267;<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> but
in this case the shell is filled with powder, which in
all probability was driven in and compressed as
tightly as possible with a mallet and drift.<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> The
German writer undoubtedly believed that his shell
would burst, for he uses such phrases as “chugel
dye da springt” and “zerspringt und zerslecht alls
umb.” Neither his shell or Valturio’s would have
exploded except under the most exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>The weakness of the shell leads Herr von
Romocki to suppose that Valturio’s plate is wrong
or grievously exaggerated. I see no grounds for
this suspicion: the shell was purposely made weak,
so that it might break into two pieces on impact and
leave the incendiary charge free to do its work. The
missile belonged to the same family as the incendiary
projectiles thrown into Roveredo by the Swiss
in 1487.<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a> There the shell was filled with pitch and
rosin: Valturio’s shell was charged with powder, but
it was probably compressed tightly into the interior
of the shell, and powder, especially serpentine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>powder, will not explode under such circumstances.
When experimenting with gunpowder
at New York, Doremus and Budd subjected good
modern powder to such hydraulic pressure as to
compress it into a solid block without interstices,
and on ignition the mass burned quietly away.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a>
Valturio’s charge was probably reduced to a state
approximating more or less closely to that of the
New York powder, and it would have exploded but
rarely and occasionally. But the mere fact that the
shell was made of bronze is a sufficient proof that it
was an incendiary missile. Even had the charge
been explosive, a bronze envelope would have been
only ripped open by it, not broken into many
pieces as iron would have been; a fact which
Valturio must have known. Finally, the gunners of
the fifteenth century were not in possession of a fuze
that would have enabled them to carry on fire with
explosive shell. The construction of such a fuze (as
will be seen in the section on “Time Fuzes”) was
the work of the following century.</p>

<p>The Berlin Firebook does not profess to give us
an account of ammunition actually used in the field;
it merely describes certain ammunition proposed for
use by a fireworker, or inventor, and it adds his
honest convictions of the way in which it would
act if manufactured. The excerpts given by Herr
von Romocki from the Firebook, in so far as they
concern the projectile in question, are simply the
specification and opinions of an inventor, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>are no grounds for supposing that his missile was
ever made or ever tried. If these projectiles had
been used with effect in the field, their inventor
would surely have been the first to tell us of their
success. There is nothing remarkable in the above
conclusion: the inventor followed the custom of his
age. The value of experiment generally, the absolute
necessity for experiment in gunnery, was unknown
or altogether underrated in the Middle Ages, and
those fireworkers who may have suspected its importance
had neither the money nor the opportunity
to put their theory into practice. Would Sextus
Julius Africanus and Marcus Græcus have bequeathed
to us certain preposterous recipes, had
they been at the pains and expense of making
them and trying them? It was Roger Bacon who
wrote: “Experimental science ignores abstract
arguments; because, strong though they may be,
their conclusions are not perfectly certain until
verified by experiment.... In these studies experiment
alone, not abstract reasoning, leads to
certain conclusions.”<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> Yet even he, with his
“everlasting lamps,” has not quite escaped the
infection of the prevailing fashion: he never tried
these lamps. Bourne has left us a whole book of
“Inventions and Devices,” and at least one half of
Boillot’s book is occupied by similar inventions;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>but neither of them makes the slightest suggestion
that any one of his contrivances was ever made or
ever tried. We may, then, discard the wholly
unpractical proposal of the Berlin Firebook, and
accept Valturio’s as the earliest incendiary cannon-shell
of which we have any detailed account.</p>

<h4><i>Carcasses.</i></h4>

<p>Carcasses were invented in 1672 by a gunner in
the service of Christopher van Galen, the fighting
Prince Bishop of Munster.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> They are mentioned in
the <cite>London Gazette</cite>, 1980/1, 1684. They were originally
oblong, in order to contain a large quantity of
incendiary matter; but their flight was so erratic
that it became necessary to make them spherical.
Their thickness was at the same time so much
reduced, in order to increase their internal capacity,
that a large proportion broke up in the bore. To
remedy this defect during the siege of Quebec,
1759, “the interval between the powder and the
carcass was filled with turf,” an arrangement which
“produced every desired effect.”<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a></p>

<h4><i>Explosive Fireballs.</i></h4>

<p>Explosive fireballs were simply hand-grenades,
which, according to the classification of ammunition
adopted here, have been already noticed, p. 169.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Explosive Shell.</i></h4>

<p>The step from Valturio’s shell to common shell
may seem to us now to have been a short and an
easy one, yet it took nearly a century to make it;
the obstacle that barred the way being neither the
envelope nor the bursting charge, but the fuze.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say exactly when, where, or
by whom explosive shell were first employed. The
want of them had been long felt everywhere, and
numberless attempts to manufacture them were
made. They may, therefore, have come into being
independently in several countries about the same
period; a supposition which receives considerable
support from the conflicting claims which have
been set up, quite honestly no doubt, to their first
employment.</p>

<p>We have sound evidence of the manufacture of
large mortars and shell in England as early as 1543.
In this year Bawd and Collet constructed mortars of
11″ to 19″ in calibre, with cast-iron shell “to be
stuffed with fireworks or wildfire,” and a match
(<i>i.e.</i> fuze) “that the firework might be set on fire
for to breake in smal pieces, whereof the smallest
piece hitting any man would kill or spoile him.”<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>Stow, to whom we owe these facts, began life as
a tailor, and was not familiar with the intricacies
of Artillery <em>matériel</em>; but it is sufficiently clear that
he speaks here of two kinds of projectiles&mdash;incendiary
shell filled with wildfire, and explosive shell
filled with firework. Whether these shell were ever
used and, if so, whether their action was successful,
there is no evidence to show; but in 1588 took
place the sieges of Bergen-op-Zoom and Wachtendonck
at which explosive shell were used with much
effect, for the first time according to the evidence
we at present possess. Reyd, whose <cite>Belgarum
aliarumque Gentium Annales</cite> was published in
1600, tells us (lib. viii., p. 182) that during the
siege of Bergen-op-Zoom “an Italian deserter to
the Dutch devoted himself to the art, hitherto
unknown, of making hollow balls of iron or stone,
which, when filled with a certain composition and
ignited, burst into innumerable fragments like grape
stones.”<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> Father Strada, S.J., in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
<cite>Hist. de la Guerre des Pays Bas</cite>, Brussels, 1739, speaks as
follows (iv. 415):&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">On bat la Ville
avec une nouvelle
espèce de balles
qu’on nomme
Bombes.</div>

<p>“Il n’y avoit rien qui épouvantait davantage les
assiégés (in Wachtendonck) que de certaines grosses
boules de fonte creuses, et remplies
de poudre et d’autres matiéres inextinguibles,
qui étant poussées en l’air
avec de gros mortiers, accabloient par
leur pésanteur tous les lieux sur qui ils tombaient,
et en même tems, comme le feu s’y prenoit par des
buses qui y étoient attachées, ils rompoient en se
crévant et embrasoient tout ce qui étoit à l’entour,
sans que l’eau le put éteindre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">L’inventeur de
ces sortes de
boulets.</div>

<p>“Cette sorte de boulet, que nous avons vû ajoûter
aux grenades, aux pots à feu, &amp;c. ... fut, dit on,
inventée un peu devant le siége de
Wachtendonck par un artisan de
Venloo.... Je sais que quelqu’un
(<i>i.e.</i> Reyd) a ecrit qu’une pareille expérience avait
été faite a Berg-op-Zoom ... avec un pareil succès
par un Italien deserteur des troupes d’Espagne. Au
reste, le Comte Mansfeld se servit de cette machine
qui fut inventée à Venloo et faisoit dans Wachtendonck
une déstruction des maisons et des hommes
aussi inévitable qu’elle étoit inopinée.”</p>

<p>These passages possess at least one quality of
good evidence&mdash;they differ about details and agree
on the main points; and it is difficult to see how
they can be gainsaid or overlooked. We may take
it, then, until further evidence (which may possibly
exist) is produced, that explosive shell were first
used in large numbers and with good effect in 1588.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV<br /><br />

<small><small>IGNITERS</small></small></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Charges</span> of incendiaries and explosives confined in
guns, shells, mines, &amp;c., are not fired directly: for
convenience and safety they are ignited by means
of some intermediate agent, or agents, such as
priming powder, fuzes, &amp;c., which are themselves in
turn ignited by some other agents. These collective
agents are here called Igniters.</p>

<h4><i>Hot Wires, Priming Powder, Matches, and
Portfires.</i></h4>

<p>The small early guns, whose recoil was insignificant,
seem to have been fired directly by thrusting
a hot wire into the powder through the vent.<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a>
When guns grew bigger, this method had to be
abandoned and priming powder came into use.<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> For
centuries priming powder consisted of serpentine,
or some slow-burning mixture, which was at first
laid in a train from some convenient spot to the
vent, and was afterwards simply poured on the vent.
The advantage of the former proceeding, in securing
the safety of the gunners, is pointed out in a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>old French book:&mdash;
“vous pourrez retirer affin que
vostre baston (<em>gun</em>) ne vous face dommage.”<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> In
the latter case, the priming was ignited in various
ways:&mdash;by a hot wire; by a match fixed in a lint-stock,
which was “a staffe of a yard or two yards
long;”<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> and later by a portfire attached to a portfire-stick.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></p>

<p>The objection to priming powder was its liability
to be wetted by rain, or blown away by wind.<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a></p>

<h4><i>Tubes.</i></h4>

<p>Priming powder was ultimately replaced by small
tubes, full of combustible matter, which fitted into
the vents of guns. Of the multitude of these tubes
only a few can be mentioned here. Tubes filled
with quickmatch, and primed with mealed powder
and spirits of wine, are said to have been in use in
the first half of the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a> In 1778
Captain Sir Charles Douglas, R.N., invented the
gun-flint-lock. It was simply a flint-and-steel
apparatus, fastened to the ventplate of the gun and
worked by a lanyard, which ignited a tube placed
in the vent. Captain Douglas introduced this lock
into his ship, the <em>Duke</em>, at his own expense, and it
worked so well that it was officially adopted for the
Navy in 1790.<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> It was owing, apparently, to the
personal intervention of General Sir Alexander
Dickson that this lock was at length adopted for
the Artillery in 1820.<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> In a letter to Sir Howard
Douglas (son of Sir Charles), 18th April 1818, Sir
Alexander gives his reasons for advocating the
change:&mdash;“By the employment of slow match only,
the fire is frequently retarded, and nothing can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>be more dangerous than lighted portfires in a
battery ... I have ever prevented, as much as in
my power, the use of portfires.”<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a></p>

<p>A percussion tube, invented by Mr. Marsh, of the
Royal Arsenal Surgery, was approved for the Navy
in 1831: the Artillery was not supplied with a
similar tube until 1846.</p>

<p>In 1841 Lieutenant Siemens, of the Hanoverian
Army, laid a friction tube before the officials of
Woolwich Arsenal, which was tried and, owing to
whatever defects, was rejected. Just ten years later
Mr. Tozer, of the Royal Laboratory, made the copper
friction tube now in use. It was officially adopted
in 1853.<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a></p>

<p>In 1860 there were no less than six tubes in the
service:&mdash;(1) the Common Quill Tube; (2) the
Dutch Paper Tube; (3) the Common Metal Tube;
(4) the Percussion Tube; (5) the Friction Tube;
and (6) the Galvanic Tube.<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a></p>

<h4><i>Time Fuzes.</i></h4>

<p>Nothing can be less satisfactory than Hassan
er-Rammah’s allusions to igniters, of which he possessed
two&mdash;the <em>rose</em> and the <em>ikreekh</em> (اكريج). The
latter word strictly means a duct, channel, or tube;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>but just as we frequently use <em>fuze</em> for <em>fuze composition</em>,
so the Arabs often use <em>ikreekh</em> for the composition
it contained. Hassan, for instance, speaks
of “the sulphur with which one makes ikreekhs.”<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a>
It is quite clear, however, from Reinaud and Favé’s
Plate II., fig. 24, that the ikreekh was of the nature
of a fuze-case. Whether the composition given here
in column 1 of Table XIII. was used in the ikreekh
or the rose, I do not know. In fact our knowledge
of these two igniters may be summed up in the
statement that they were used together in the same
(incendiary) shell, and that it was the rose which
was lighted.<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a> The ikreekh possibly contained the
fuze composition proper, and the rose corresponded
to our priming matter.</p>

<p>Judging from the plates of Kyeser’s <em>Bellifortis</em>
reproduced by Herr von Romocki (i. 169), the
igneous projectiles of 1405 were ignited by some
slow-burning composition, which was put on the
top of the charge, and filled up the loading hole
flush with the exterior of the missile. The breech-loading
quill fuze of the second Berlin Firebook,
mentioned in the section on “Explosive Shell,”
seems to have been only the abortive proposal of an
inventor.</p>

<p>The foregoing Arab and German igniters were
for use in machine and hand projectiles, and we
now reach cannon fuzes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p>The first igneous gun-missiles were incendiary,
at once hand-grenades and cannon-balls, and were
ignited by means of some slow-burning mixture,
without a case, which was put into the shell on
the top of its charge. When the missile is
“neere full (of good come pouder),” says Bourne,
“take some receite of soft fire worke that will not
burne too hastily and fill up the rest of the ball.”<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a>
That the fuze-hole was originally placed next the
cartridge is shown by Boillot’s repeated directions
to turn it towards the muzzle<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a>&mdash;directions which
would have been superfluous had it not been previously
customary to place it next the cartridge;
and by many other indications. By this mode of
loading the ignition of the fuze composition was
ensured before the projectile left the piece. There
was perhaps no absolute necessity for the use of
this soft, slow-burning mixture, with incendiary
shell so placed; but it was probably found very
useful in confining the charge within the missile
during flight.</p>

<p>The need of an explosive projectile to blow up
earthworks, &amp;c., was more and more felt as time
rolled on, and the use of such missiles was clearly
impossible with such igniters so placed. But the
best way of mending matters was by no means so
clear. If an explosive shell was placed in the bore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>with an igniter of soft, caseless composition next the
cartridge, there was in the great majority of rounds a
burst in the bore. If the shell was reversed, with
the igniter towards the face of the piece, either
the composition did not ignite and the shell was
blind, or the soft composition set back into the
shell from the shock of the explosion<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> and again
there was a burst in the bore. Furthermore, in
firing against works it was before all things necessary
that the shell should enter the revetment, &amp;c.,
before it exploded, and it was extremely difficult
in practice to put into the shell the exact amount
of composition that would burn just longer than
the time of flight. To prevent the gases of the
explosion from forcing their way into the interior
of the shell, it was necessary to have the fuze-hole
towards the muzzle when the shell was home. To
prevent the soft composition from setting back, and
to ensure that it was sufficient in quantity to burn
longer than the time of flight, a fuze-case was necessary.
To ensure the ignition of the fuze (in its new
position) it was necessary to light it from the muzzle
just before the piece was fired, and this condition
restricted the use of explosive shell for centuries
to mortars and (afterwards) howitzers. No one
would have dared to thrust a lit match down the
bore of a gun which had been loaded with loose
powder by means of a ladle, and cartridges were
not in general use when the question of explosive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>shell arose. Bourne says in 1587: “It is a great
deal better for to charge a peace in time of service
with a cartredge than with a ladell,”<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> and he presently
proceeds to give his reasons for thinking so
at great length.<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> In the beginning of the following
century, Diego Ufano only allows the use of cartridges
when a ladle is not at hand.</p>

<p>Such were the steps of the evolution of the fuze,
as partially explained by Hanzelet and Thybovrel
in their <cite>Receuil de plusieurs Machines Militaires</cite>,
published in 1620: “Le souspirail de l’amorce (the
funnel of the priming = the fuze-case) est long ... et
creux.... Ainsi ce canal éstant emply de composition
lente, il ne permet que le feu se prenne
qu’il nait (n’ait) lentement consumé la matière mise
audit canal, et par ce moyen le feu ne peut toucher
la poudre grainée (the bursting charge) qu’il ne
soit arrivé jusques au fond de la ditte grenade.
Cela sert pour avoir loisir de la jetter à la main,
ou de l’allumer et la mettre dans le mortier ou
canon” (l. iv. c. 6).</p>

<p>One of the first indications of a fuze with a
case is afforded by a passage in Stow’s “Annals”
for the year 1543, where he speaks of “hollow
shot of cast-yron, to be stuffed with fireworks or
wild fire; whereof the bigger sort had screwes of
yron to receive a match” (p. 584). Stow was
evidently describing something which he did not
understand, but his meaning is made clear by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Boillot. The fuze-case was a hollow, cylindrical
male screw which fitted a female screw in the fuze-hole,
and when fixed extended across the cavity
of the shell: “En laquelle (the shell) laisserez
un trou ... auquelle ferés faire une viz pour le
bien boucher, laquelle sera de la longeur de la
grenade” (p. 163). Further on he speaks of the
case as “un tuyau de fer blanc ou cuivre ... bien
adjousté au dit trou,” and directs it to be
filled “bien massif de pouldre sans graine.” It was
lighted from the muzzle of the mortar by a quick-match
or hand-fuze,<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> as Nye directs half a century
afterwards&mdash;light the fuze first, “and then with
great speed give fire to the touch-hole” (chap. v.).</p>

<p>Diego Ufano describes experiments carried on
during the latter years of the sixteenth, or the early
years of the seventeenth century, with cased fuzes of
a new patterns<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> proposed by the (then) Governor of
Genappe. The fuze, which was filled with moist
powder or one of several mixtures given by Ufano,
was placed next the cartridge.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> The first shell
fired burst at the muzzle, the second burst short.
Two rounds were then fired from an English 60-pr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>(<em>carthaunen</em>), both of which burst in the air and
damaged houses and walls in their neighbourhood.
A third shell lodged in the ground at a distance
of 250 yards,<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> and on bursting sent its fragments
back towards the gun, damaging a guard-room<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a>
which stood 150 yards in rear of it. The experiments
then ceased, on the urgent representations
of an Artillery officer about the risk they
were all running. The earlier fuzes implicitly
referred to by Ufano were doubtless the “buses”
which, Father Strada tells us, were employed at
Wachtendonck in 1588. Their name, buses = tubes
or pipes, is sufficient proof that they were fuzes with
cases. In his “Gunner,” 1628, p. 156, Norton
speaks of a “pype primed with slow receipt” for
exploding shell. We find the very same word
applied to fuzes in Danish official documents in
1644: “piber til Granater,” pipes for shell.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> Writing
three years afterwards, Nye, Master-Gunner of
Worcester, speaks familiarly of <em>fuzes</em> which were
conical in shape, for he compares them to “faucets
for a spigot.”<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> He says: “The match doth ofttimes
fail, but fuzes are very certain to give fire.”</p>

<p>There were no means of regulating the time of
burning of these pipes, which were generally metallic.
The composition had a constant (and unalterable)
length, corresponding roughly to that required for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>the <em>maximum</em> range at which shell could be fired.
Whatever the range, the oblong bombs were fired
with a fuze that burned some fourteen seconds, answering
to about 1000 yards range; the spherical
grenados with a fuze that burned some twenty
seconds, answering to about 2100 yards range.<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> In
firing against works, &amp;c., it was essential that mortar
shell&mdash;and until the siege of Gibraltar, 1779, all
shell were mortar or howitzer shell<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a>&mdash;should not
burst before impact. A shell which burst in flight
was a shell wasted, but it mattered little whether it
burst on impact or a few seconds afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> But
it was occasionally necessary to use shell against
troops, and it was then that the radical defect of
the tube became fully manifest. In this case it was
desirable that the fuze should fire the bursting
charge the instant the shell touched the ground,<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a>
and this was impracticable with the primitive pipe.
While the long fuze was burning down to its end,
the explosion might be prevented, or its effects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>might be neutralised in many ways. The shell
might be thrown bodily into a pond or the sea;<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a>
the fuze might be extracted;<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> or it might be extinguished
with water.<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> But in the vast majority of
cases the explosion of the shell was neutralised in
a much homelier and less heroic way; those near
whom it fell waited for no command to quit its
neighbourhood in all haste.</p>

<p>It was long before any real progress was made
in the adjustment of fuzes to burn a certain time,
chiefly because the early gunners had no timekeeper.
A striking illustration of this fact is found in the
<cite>Artis Magnæ Artilleriæ</cite>, &amp;c., of Siemienowicz, published
in 1650. Wishing to give his readers an idea
of the action of a certain fireball, he explains that it
burned in the time one takes to recite deliberately
the Apostles’ Creed.<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a></p>

<p>The first, so far as is known, who urged the adjustment
of fuzes was Sebastian Hälle,<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a> in 1596, and
he fared as fare most of those who see further than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>their fellows. The many failed to see the object
which he saw clearly; therefore (they said) the
object did not exist, and he was a dreamer. A
century after his death, however, gunners began to
discover that his dreams were substantial enough;
and in 1682 Zeug-Lieut. Buchner dilates upon the
advantages of a fuze that will burn <em>ein gewiss
Tempo</em><a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a>&mdash;a certain time. The mere fact that there
were at least three different kinds of fuze in use
towards the close of the seventeenth century&mdash;paper,
wood, and iron<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a>&mdash;proves that the search for
a serviceable fuze was going actively forward. The
excellent plates given by Buchner and Mieth show
clearly that their fuzes were bored. In both cases
the rate of burning was tested with difficulty, owing
to the want of a practical timekeeper. Buchner
recommends the use of a pendulum, or very careful
beating time (or counting);<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> Mieth alludes to the
pendulum, but evidently put little trust in it, for he
adds, “The correct time can be only found by trial
shell.”<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a></p>

<p>By the middle of the eighteenth century we had
beechwood fuzes, which were cut. The rate of burning
was determined “by burning two or three, and
making use of a watch or string by way of pendu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>lum.”<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a>
It was observed about this period that when
fuzes were cut very short, either the flame failed to
reach the bursting charge and the shell went blind,
or the thin disc of fuze composition set back into
the shell from the shock of the discharge and the
shell burst in the bore. To obviate this Muller
proposed to provide special fuzes, with a quicker-burning
composition than usual, for use at short
ranges.<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> This plan was temporarily adopted, for we
find that there were three different fuzes in our
service in 1779, one that burned an inch in 5
seconds, a second that burned an inch in 4.5 seconds,
and a third that burned an inch in 4 seconds.
It is evident, however, from a remark made by the
Inspector of the Royal Military Academy, Captain
George Smith, R.A., in his “Universal Military
Dictionary” (from which these details have been
taken) that the standard of shell fire in the year
1779 was a low one. “When the distance of the
battery from the object is known, the time of the
shell’s flight may be computed to a second or two.”
Extreme regularity of burning, then, was not expected:
an error of “a second or two” in the time
of flight was of trivial importance. But an event
happened in Gibraltar in this very year which
suddenly raised the standard to a height that no
one could have foreseen&mdash;the adoption of Captain
Mercier’s method of shell-fire from guns, with short
fuzes. This system ended with the siege; it was
never resorted to, probably, outside the gates of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>Gibraltar; and, more probably still, when the siege
was over things fell gradually back into the unruffled
quiet of routine. But the calm was only momentary,
for in 1803 appeared Shrapnel shell, and with them
reappeared Captain Mercier’s forgotten system of
“calculated fuzes.”</p>

<p>From the first moment it was beyond all doubt
that the ultimate success of Shrapnel could be only
assured by the use of what no Artillery then possessed&mdash;a
thoroughly good time-fuze. Writing to
Major (afterwards General Sir Thomas) Downman,
R.A., on the 29th Feb. 1804, Shrapnel remarks that
in firing at short ranges the fuze composition “gives
way into the shell once in ten times,”<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> thus producing
a burst in the bore; and as a remedy he suggests
cutting all fuzes 1¼″ long and then sawing a cut
through the bottom of the fuze, in a plane passing
through its longer axis, <em>up</em> to the desired length.
However, notwithstanding all precautions, of the
1090 shell fired during the Woolwich experiments
with Shrapnel in 1819, 74 burst in the bore, 71
burst in the butt, and 111 were blind, <i>i.e.</i> 23.4 per
cent. were failures.<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> No efforts were spared to improve
these fuzes or replace them by better ones, and
a large number were proposed, or constructed, during
the second quarter of the last century. In 1850 there
were no less than nineteen time-fuzes in our service:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>three of metal and sixteen of wood. Of the latter, ten
were Shrapnel fuzes, viz. an 8″, a 5½″and a 1″ fuze,
which were uncut; and seven fuzes which were cut
ready for use, and lettered A for .1″, B for .2″,&mdash;G for
.7″.<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> This medley of fuzes was gradually superseded
by a wooden time-fuze proposed in 1849 by an officer
who had a genius for ammunition, Captain (afterwards
General) E. M. Boxer, R.A., and adopted in 1850.
In the final pattern of this fuze, adopted early in
1854, England possessed probably the best fuze in
Europe.</p>

<h4><i>Percussion and Concussion Fuzes.</i></h4>

<p>The earliest proposal for igniting the bursting
charges of shell by percussion appears to have been
made in 1596 by Sebastian Hälle.<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> A similar proposal
was made in 1610 by Graf Johann von Nassau
in a MS. now in possession of the Royal Library,
Berlin (MS. Germ. fol. 4), where two hand-grenades
are described which explode on being let fall on the
ground. The second differs from the first in having
a safety apparatus to prevent premature explosions,
but both are based on the same principle as Hälle’s:
flints and steel so arranged as to strike together on
impact with the ground.<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> In 1650 Siemienowicz
gives a description (with plates) of similar grenades,
without a safety arrangement,<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> which Mieth regarded
as “curiosities” specially adapted to hurry those who
meddled with them into the next world.<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> Yet
Buchner mentions them in 1682,<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> and Anderson in
1691,<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> without any (expressed) misgivings of their
danger. We may rest assured that these man-traps
were never used on actual service.</p>

<p>The use of percussion powder to ignite the
bursting charges of shells was first definitely pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>posed,
I believe, by Johann Jürgenson von Trachenfels
in 1655;<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a> just seven years after Glauber had
drawn attention to such mixtures in his <cite>Philosophischen
Öfen</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> Trachenfels’ proposals were never
put into practice, and no attempt was made to apply
percussion powders to military purposes for more
than a century. Fulminating silver, discovered by
Berthollet towards the close of the eighteenth century,
could not be utilised owing to the violence of
its detonation. After Howard’s discovery of fulminating
mercury in 1800, a number of percussion
mixtures were made; but seven years passed before
Rev. Alexander Forsyth proposed to use them for
the priming of firearms,<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> and eleven years more
elapsed before it occurred to Colonel Peter Hawker
to enclose percussion priming in a copper cap.<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> The
percussion musket did not make its appearance until
1842.</p>

<p>The first English concussion fuze<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a> was invented
by Quartermaster Freeburn, R.A., in 1846; the
first percussion fuze by Commander Moorsom, R.N.,
in 1850.</p>

Reinaud and Favé, p. 14. The phrase, “flower of the stone of Assos,” was
a thousand years old when Abd Allah used it, for we find it in Lucian’s
<cite>Tragodopodagra</cite> (ἄνθος Ἀσίου λίθου, l. 162), a work written <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 180-200.
But, like so many other words, it completely changed its meaning
in the lapse of years. Abd Allah used it to designate saltpetre:
Pliny the elder (“Nat. Hist.,” xxxvi. 17) tells us it had the property of
utterly consuming dead bodies, except the teeth, in forty days&mdash;a
property saltpetre does not possess.</p></div>

MM. Reinaud and Favé and Herr von Romocki in identifying him
with Dioskorides. The evidence (from the description of the cyclamen
and the preparation of the syrup) seems to point the other way. The
past tense, <em>dixit</em>, in the passage in the text, would seem to show that
Ibn Serapion was dead when it was written. The present tense, <em>dicit</em>,
indicates similarly that “Græcus” was then living, a contemporary of
Masawyah’s. Yet Dutens speaks of his having lived “avant le médicin

The editor, Mr. Thomas Wright, remarks in his preface, xxxv.:&mdash;“The
mariner’s compass, in a rude form, was in use among the sailors
in Western Europe at an early period, and ... instead of being borrowed
from the East, as is generally supposed, it seems to have been
invented in this part of the world. Of course I do not mean to say
that it was not invented in other parts also.” It is explicitly noticed
in a Chinese Encyclopædia finished in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 121 (Sir J. Davis, “The
Chinese,” &amp;c., ii 185). But Chinese chronology is always suspicious,
and, even if this date be correct, there is no evidence to show that the
invention ever reached the West. The Chinese seem to have guarded
their discoveries and inventions with a jealous eye. Their valuable
and accurate astronomical observations were only laid open to Europe by
the Jesuits, more than two thousand years after they were made. The
printing press was not invented in Europe until the fifteenth century,
yet Feng Tao had invented block-printing in China in the tenth
(Giles’ “Chinese Literature,” p. 210). According to their own account,
the Chinese have used tea since the year 2737 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> It was not heard
of in Europe until after <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1517, and did not become generally
known until the seventeenth century. Brunetto Latini (1230-94),
quoted by Davis, gives a curious, but only too probable a reason for
the slow progress of the compass in Christendom: “No master mariner
dares to use (it), lest he should fall under the suspicion of being a
magician.”</p></div>

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_277" id="Footnote_277"></a><a href="#FNanchor_277"><span class="label">277</span></a> Elliot, v. 131-2. Babar’s ironical description of the Bengalis as
gunners is taken quite seriously by some writers: “The Bengalis are
famous for their skill in Artillery.... They do not direct their fire
against a particular point, but discharge at random,” Elliot, iv. 285.
Such a procedure is not altogether unknown in Europe. When shooting,
Mr. Tracy Tupman was wont to shut his eyes firmly and fire in
the air.
</p>
<p>
Were these gunners friendly Bengalis employed by Babar, or hostile
Bengalis working their own guns? If the latter, their guns were probably
made by Portuguese deserters. We know that two artisans
deserted in 1503 to the Zamorin of Calicut, for whom they offered to
make guns of the same nature as the Portuguese, “which they afterwards
did.” Castenheda in Kerr’s “Collection of Voyages,” ii. 454,

The 15½″ mortar, under Firemaster Thomas Wright, which accompanied
a small force sent by Cromwell in 1651 to reduce the Royalist
castle of Elizabeth in Jersey, may have been one of Bawd and Collet’s.
Between five and ten rounds were fired daily for several days without
any damage to the piece, although the carriage broke down completely
on two occasions. The range was 1540 yards, and the shooting accurate.
The first round, we may feel certain, was laid with extreme care.
“I proffered to lay a wager of ten pounds with Captain Dover,” says
the Firemaster, “that my first shot should strike the Castle, ... and
by God’s providence it did strike one side of the great Tower, where
the Granado brake” (<i>i.e.</i> exploded). The second shell “brake verie
kindly,” and for the third he “altered (the) degrees of elevation.”
Captain Dover may have paid his bet, but the Ordnance Office forgot
to remit Wright’s pay; hence the “Perfect Narrative of the Particular
Service performed by Firemaster Thomas Wright,” &amp;c. &amp;c., 1651.
The word <i>explode</i> is not found before the seventeenth century&mdash;see
Dr. Murray’s “New English Dictionary”&mdash;and was sparingly used in
Wright’s time.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
